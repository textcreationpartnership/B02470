            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>NOvels of late have been ſo ill writ, and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſo little eſteem'd, that 'tis reaſonably to be ſuppos'd a Bookſeller has not ſuch another drug in his Shop. I was too weak to attempt the recovery of their loſt honour, and therefore choſe a new method of my own.</p>
            <p>This may appear ſomething odd to the Reader, becauſe it inſinuates as much as if I had ſaid, I writ Novels in Subſtance, but alter'd the Form. I confeſs I deſign to leave him in the dark; and he may ſuppoſe the ſtories ſo many real truths, or ſo many little Romances as his fancy or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall guide him.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that I feign'd Nations, which is a thing rarely or never practis'd. I anſwer, if I make people bring them to good or bad ends, and keep their Lives and Honours in my own hands; by the ſame Authority I can eaſily create a Country to ſettle them in. If the Amours be real, I ought in good manners to lay the Scenes in a new World, becauſe 'tis to be ſuppos'd I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd them not for</p>
            <q>—Monumenta Veneris Nefandae.</q>
            <p>And to be particular as to the Kingdoms, were the true way to diſcover thoſe concern'd.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:179798:3"/>
            <p> The Adventures of the <hi>Unfortunate Dutcheſs</hi> are but few, not that the Subject could afford no more, but becauſe I had not much time to imploy that way. Beſides my Printer o're-took me e're 'twas well begun, and hurry'd me to a ſpeedy cloſe. <hi>Daria</hi>'s are indeed too long, but I hope the Reader will not think it ſo. I've ſhown <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theon</hi> good Natur'd, and upon all emergencies tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Generous, and if I have made him too eaſie, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the cauſe to his exceſs of Love, and <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phile's</hi> irreſiſtleſs Charms. The firſt confin'd his reſentment, and the latter diſarm'd his fury. The Dutcheſs's Conduct is not to be juſtified, but you will find I ſcarce deſign'd any of my Lovers for exact patterns of Chaſtity and Honour. Theſe romantick ways of Writing and Loving are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tedious, and very rarely credited. If ſometimes I mention every Circumſtance of an Action, or the Joys of an happy Night, 'tis only to make the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appear more probable, and to Cozen the Reader into a firmer belief of what may in it ſelf be fiction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Love after Enjoyment,</hi> &amp;c. can hardly be thought a Miſnomer, ſince <hi>Adraſtus</hi> in all his words and Actions ſpeaks an exceſſive tenderneſs and paſſion for <hi>Timandra,</hi> nor did ſhe ever ſhow leſs for him. That in his abſence ſhe married the Duke of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noya,</hi> can hardly be reputed a breach of Love, ſince for her excuſe ſhe reaſonably alledges, the World was too buſie with her Name, and 'twas high time to ſalve her reputation, leſt the remedy had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards come too late, or it may be not at all. The ſtory of <hi>Olmechine</hi> is in my opinion very Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſhe Lov'd him, yet was Virtuous, and forgot that paſſion ſhe had for him when <hi>Avilon</hi> (who firſt had ſought her Heart) return'd. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb facs="tcp:179798:3"/> the Earl of <hi>Rucana,</hi> may at firſt ſight ſeem too nice to gain the Reputation of a Truth; but the Reader will hardly find any thing in it, that is not very probable, and in all points practicable.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Unhappy Miſtake</hi> it may perhaps be thought that I have been guilty of one my ſelf, in crowding ſo many People into ſo ſhort a ſtory. <hi>Xenſa</hi> and <hi>Mangroa</hi> might have both been Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowers, and <hi>Bonzeda</hi> had loſt nothing had I robb'd him of a ſiſter. But I'm confident 'twill appear otherwiſe to any Man that deliberately weighs the Plott, nor will he find it any difficulty to remember every Man's buſineſs, Pretentions and Intereſt throughout the whole. <hi>Delia</hi>'s Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may indeed be too long. But you will find by the end of her own and <hi>Sirena's</hi> ſtory, that I was ſenſible of my errour e're 'twas fully committed. I had waſted too much Paper; and was forc'd to kill more People in one Leaf, than I deſign'd at firſt in two. Yet after all, <hi>Martius</hi> and <hi>Artaxus</hi> fell not without Circumſtances, that largely entituled their deaths to probability and truth. As for <hi>Ericis,</hi> I was forc'd to uſe her ill, leſt Treachery had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcap'd unpuniſh'd. And <hi>Manderina</hi>'s end might very well be occaſion'd by her griefs, if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her loſs.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought no leſs than neceſſary, in defence of particulars, and as for general faults, I preſume they may all be comprehended under this one. The paſſions are not painted with the height of Modeſty. If there is any thing that appears ſmutty I'm confident a Lady can hardly own ſhe knows it to be ſo, unleſs at the ſame time ſhe confeſs her own guilt, and lewd inclinations. For to the truly Virtuous 'tis ſo well cover'd, it will hardly
<pb facs="tcp:179798:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhow it ſelf. Beſides, to expreſs any thing of that Nature nicely, methinks requires more of Art, and neat choice of words, than a paſſion truly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, and if well done, is in ſome meaſure pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; but that is what I would not be thought to defend, even tho' I were truly guilty.</p>
            <p>I've nothing to ſay in relation to my ſtyle or way of expreſſing my ſelf, I writ them for my own pleaſure and improvement in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language, and by conſequence ſtrove not to be too nice or elaborate, yet to ſhun that trouble, you will find I've borrow'd nothing from others to indulge my wants.</p>
            <p>The Reader will find an exceſs of grief or joy expreſs'd with meaſure, the better to move the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as for what's purely narrative, I have us'd a natural way free from force or Affectation.</p>
            <p>The worſt of Criticks pretend to ſome Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and ſpare dead Authors. In reaſon they ought to ſhow the ſame goodneſs to a ſtranger, eſpecially when he is abſent; if they do, then I ſhall be ſafe, and this little Poſthumus may ſtay behind, and live without its Father to protect and defend it.</p>

                  <p>WHEN I firſt had the honour of your acquaintance, amongſt thoſe number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Qualities that render'd you ſo amiable, and your Converſation ſo charming and eaſie; I found that eſteem you had for Plays and Novels, to be none of the leaſt conſiderable. It ſpeaks a tender Soul, and a large Portion of wit. To pity a feign'd Hero is commendable, becauſe 'tis a ſure Argument, that Compaſſion would not be wanting to a real one. And to delight in thoſe things, which have a certain Air or Paſſion well repreſented in them, ſhews that the fancy of the Reader, is little or nothing inferiour to that of the Writer; for we can take no more pleaſure in that which we underſtand not, than in thoſe things which we underſtand too well. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the weight of a few lazy Minutes, I ſend you the fam'd amour of a Lady, whom a long Scene of Gallantry has at laſt render'd obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:179798:7"/> to the Laws of her Country. Her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes make her too well known, and tho' ſhe is at preſent the Theme of her own Nation, I am confident the ſtory has not yet reach'd yours. I'm no ſuch Stranger to your Modeſty, as not to foreſee, that an exact account of ſome Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances would ſeem culpable; and therefore ſhall not give you juſt grounds for anger, where my aim is to divert: Yet that I may not omit thoſe things without which the Story would be too imperfect; I beg a greater liberty than is perhaps truly adequate to the narrow rules of a preciſe modeſty. I'm too unfortunate if you think my Nature loads me beyond thoſe bounds; and I hope if any thing of that kind eſcape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poliſh'd, or without a neceſſary Cover, you will attribute it to ſome other cauſe, or at leaſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend your Judgment, till you ſee the Author, and permit him to anſwer for himſelf. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe all other faults, remember <hi>I</hi> love too much to Write well, and that when I'd fix my thoughts upon this Subject, I'm ſurpris'd to find my Soul rides Poſt to you, and leaves me robb'd of Fancy or Deſign.</p>

No Man could ſee her and preſerve his liberty, and therefore no Man could think himſelf ſecure in the poſſeſſion; yet all the Youth of the Nation ſigh'd for her, and thoſe whom Fortune had not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:179798:7"/> bleſt with Wealth, gaz'd on the happy exalted Fair, and had thoſe thoughts for her, which we bear to diſtant Heaven, when yet we cannot paint the glorious Fabrick, or hope to reach the Bleſſing. Her Father (the Earl of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſala)</hi> lov'd her more than Honour; he bleſt the Gods for this mighty gift, and with pride ſaw himſelf the Maſter of a thouſand Hearts, by being the envied diſpoſer of the Lovely <hi>Eriphile.</hi> The travelling God, in all his race, ne're ſaw a form like hers beneath him; Love threw his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows through the yielding Air, or ſhot at random to conſume the trifles, her Eyes too faſt ſupply the wilful loſs, and ſtrike even thoſe who ne're before had bow'd. She ſeem'd the unknown Agent of the all-conquering <hi>Jove;</hi> for tho' ſhe had the ſoftneſs of a pitying Goddeſs, and the languiſhing looks of a yielding Virgin, yet her frowns out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretch'd thunder, and ſhook the very State of powerful Love. Believe me, <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to expreſs her Charms and Wit, were to to ſay ſhe copied you; and had ſhe prov'd as nicely Virtuous, ſhe had been indeed another Miracle. But Beauty too often proves fatal to the owner, and a handſome Face an Enemy to Honour. All men admire the truly Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and continued Aſſaults muſt needs ſhake the beſieg'd, or force them at leaſt to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the numerous Youth of <hi>Armenis,</hi> none could yet pretend to merit the happineſs of her eſteem, and the Young Lovers had no relief from pains, but when they remember'd, that time muſt advance one to the Heaven they aim
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:179798:8"/> at, and knew not but indulgent Providence had deſign'd the Bliſs for them.</p>
                     <p>While thus ſhe reign'd, abſolute in the Hearts of a thouſand noble Subjects, the Great Duke of <hi>Entheon</hi> arriv'd from his Travels. Him too ſhe Conquer'd, but pay'd her Liberty as a price for the glorious Victory. He is the firſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Country, yet Maſter of a Soul that infinitely ſurmounts his Birth or Quality. He has the Courage of a Man in deſpair, yet attended with the Caution and diffidency of a Coward, or one who values Life. Like Heaven ſlow to Anger, but if it concerns his Fame, ſudden in the Execution, and quicker than Lightning. The liberality of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Prince, and the careful management of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Subject, are equally his. He has the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the good and wiſe, without the Biggotry of the ſuperſtitious and ignorant: Looks like a Crown'd Head, yet more affable than the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Courtier, and values the honour of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country beyond his private intereſt, or his dearer Life. Admir'd by all men but himſelf, and envied by none but Villains, who damn thoſe Virtues in others, to which themſelves can ne're attain. He ſpeaks moſt Languages, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in the Hiſtory of moſt Nations. In ſhort, Madam, 'tis generally ſaid of him, that his Birth and breeding, make him truly the firſt Gentleman in the World. <hi>Sindalon</hi> thought her ſelf enrich'd beyond her Neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and the happy Inhabitants of <hi>Armenis,</hi> look'd on this miraculous Youth, as their Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us or Guardian Angel. Every Man became his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:179798:8"/> Votary, and thoſe who had ſpent moſt of their Years abroad, felt yet thoſe little qualms, and diſturbances of Mind when they approach'd him, which baſhful Strangers know in ſhining Courts, when ey'd by Godlike Monarchs. The faireſt Ladies in <hi>Cluſa</hi> ſigh'd for him, the King doated upon him, and all the World bleſt him. <hi>Ciſala</hi> amongſt the reſt, fail'd not to ſhew that eſteem he had for him; and the Duke, who greedily had heard his Daughter's Beauty univerſally proclaim'd, forgot not to embrace his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he long'd to ſee the Original, which his Fancy, at ſecond hand, began to form even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what it was, or Nature e're cou'd make, and already believ'd that in all his Travels he had ſeen nothing comparable to the Fair <hi>Eriphile.</hi> The Earl's Country Houſe was ſituated on the fertile Banks of that famous River which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupplies <hi>Cluſa</hi> with daily Neceſſaries, and as it peaceably glides along waſhes the Walls of its Monarch's Garden. Thither the noble Youth went to confirm the loſs of his Liberty, which already he had half reſign'd. <hi>Ciſala</hi> receiv'd him with that reſpect, his merit every where exacted, without regard to Quality, and now thought he had found a Husband worthy of his Daughter; yet doubtful of his wiſh'd ſucceſs he acquainted the Fair One with the arrival of his Noble Gueſt. 'Twas impoſſible to live in <hi>Armenis,</hi> and not to have heard of him; ſhe underſtood the meaning of this Advertiſement, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd carefully dreſt her ſelf to the beſt advantage, an Art very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in Ladies, and in which thoſe of her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are particularly skill'd. The Earl diverted him ſome time with the Rarities of his Houſe,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:179798:9"/> and ſhew'd him ſeveral pieces of exquiſite paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, done by the greateſt Maſters of the Age. <hi>Entheon</hi> felt a certain unexpreſſible diſquiet, when he view'd a well-done Landskip, and wanted ſomething which theſe Scenes ſuggeſted to his fancy, yet could harldly conſult his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to find what 'twas he ſigh'd for. At laſt they reſolv'd to take a turn in the Garden; where the Earl meeting with ſome Friends that had come to ſee him that Evening, was oblig'd to beg the Duke's Pardon, and promis'd to wait upon him in a very few Minutes. <hi>Entheon</hi> now left alone, and about to purſue his walk, was ſuddenly arreſted by a Song that charm'd his Soul, and ty'd up all his thoughts. He won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that he had not heard this Godlike Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, but fancy'd the Charm was juſt begun, or not heard to perfection, becauſe of his paſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the Earl. He ſtood ſometime im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, yet impatient to ſee her that ſung ſo like an Angel; he reſolv'd to loſe one part of his preſent happineſs for the purchaſe of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and, guided by the Heavenly Voice, with eager ſteps he reach'd at laſt the Grove. His Curioſity (tho' great) did not too far extend it ſelf; his paſſion ne're o're-rul'd his Judgment, and this juncture he manag'd with the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of old Age: For tho he could have enter'd, as if chance not deſign had led him, yet he choſe rather to keep himſelf undiſcover'd, and to be bleſt unknown. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hen he advanc'd, and ſoftly had preſt down thoſe ſmall boughs that obſtructed his ſight, how much was he ſurpris'd! to paint his thoughts, were a labour fit for a Muſe at her full Strength! let this ſuffice, he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:179798:9"/> ſaw <hi>Eriphile,</hi> and grew divinely mad. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality was forgot, and he remain'd in that exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which if expreſt would ſeem wholly irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, to any Man but a tranſported Lover. The Fair One lay in a careleſs Poſture, extended on the yielding Graſs. Her Foot and half the Leg were obvious to his ſight, and the ſcanty Bliſs prompted his lingering Soul to Paint the Beauties yet unſeen, even beyond the Original, or what Nature when ſhe us'd her utmoſt Art could form. He curſt his Fortune that ſhew'd no more, or elſe expos'd too much, and fear'd that a ſhape ſo far beyond what his eager thoughts had created, ſhould be attended with the alloy of a homely Face; ſtill waiting with the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency of a Man half bleſt, till ſome kind acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſhould encreaſe the pleaſure. She, who dreamt not of a prying Lover, proves kind with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſign, and taking her favourite Maid by the Hand (with an accent that gave a perfect har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to all her words) ſuddenly cry'd, my Dear <hi>Daria</hi> (for that was her Name) I've un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily loſt one of my Garters. The Duke had no time to weigh his coming Fortune, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently loſt part of the bleſſing, for the charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Eriphile</hi> had no ſooner ſaid ſo, than he could ſee the Pettycoat gently remov'd. The pleaſure of a longing ſtranger, when the furling Curtain ſhews a guilded Scene, and warlike Muſick Charms the unſteady thoughts, ſickens the Mind and thrills the kindl'd blood, but ne're yet gave a Joy confus'd like his. His tranſports were ſuch (which ſome will think next door to impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) that even Nature was huſht, the Soul alone imploy'd, and <hi>Plato</hi>'s way of loving was here
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:179798:10"/> practis'd to Perfection. Yet 'tis probable that had the old Philoſopher himſelf ſeen ſo much, he had quit the Argument, and given the Body a conqueſt o're the Soul. The amorous Duke, bleſt too much, was unable to contain himſelf, and after he had at once ſurvey'd the tempting Object, and her more bewitching Face, ſuddenly cry'd, Oh Heavens! Can ſo much Beauty ever give her ſelf up to the embraces of a Mortal? Sure 'tis anticipating Heaven to lye panting in her Arms.—'Twas well the Fair One ſtarted from the Ground, the Lover elſe had prejudg'd the Duke, and his raptures had ſpoke his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not the ſame he poſſeſt the preceeding mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute. But a violent Love ſeldom knows any bounds, and when powerful Beauty ſuddenly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults the Heart, Reaſon is often diſlodg'd, or at leaſt gives way, and then 'tis pardonable if a Man rave. However he begg'd a thouſand Pardons for his Sin of ignorance, and told her, that tho' he thought himſelf infinitely bleſt by this Encounter; yet he could have wiſh'd it had hapned at a time when ſhe was leſs diſpos'd to Solitude: And offer'd to retire, that by his ſpeedy abſence ſhe might retrieve a part of that ſilent pleaſure ſhe had loſt, tho' not before he had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd her, that if his Curioſity had led him to the Grove, he paid the Forfeiture of his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as a puniſhment for his offence. The bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maid, not knowing he had ſeen ſo much, was pleas'd with the accident; their mutual ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe added to the Beauties of both, and ſhe found by her forc'd ſilence, that the Duke was already more than indifferent to her. Yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd of this new weakneſs, ſhe ſtrove ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:179798:10"/> to recollect her ſelf, and confuſedly told him, ſhe preſum'd he was the Duke of <hi>Entheon;</hi> that her Father and the whole World ſpoke advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſly of him, and ſhe could not think her ſelf unfortunate in the Converſation of a Man ſo univerſally eſteem'd. But that if he paid too great a price for that which enrich'd her, ſhe would be ſo generous as not to urge him to ſo much bounty, notwithſtanding of thoſe advantages ſhe might reap by it. This was indeed an obliging Compliment, but the fair <hi>Eriphile</hi> already lov'd him, and already knew it. She had too much wit therefore to loſe ſo favourable an opportunity of engaging a Man, for whom the greateſt Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Iſland would have diſpenc'd with the out-gaurds of Modeſty, or rather the ſuperfluous niceties impos'd by Cuſtom not Reaſon upon thoſe of her Sex. On the other hand the Duke thought himſelf in Heaven. His exceſs of Joy almoſt deny'd him the uſe of his Reaſon, and if ever he was non-plus'd, let me ſuppoſe this the time. However from what ſhe ſaid, he gueſt his ſtay could not be altogether unſeaſonable. And after he had wittily acknowledg'd the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſhe did him, was about to begin Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums on her Beauty, when the Earl arriv'd and made the Number four. He told the young Lover, he was glad to find his abſence ſupply'd by the Converſation of a young Lady, in whom if he found any thing agreeable he was doubly Fortunate. This too was a handſome begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the Duke (who had too noble a Soul not to be amorous) that moment renounc'd his Liberty, which was repaid with hers. To have ſeen this lovely Pair, would have kindl'd flames
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:179798:11"/> in others, when icy Age had baniſh'd native Heat. The Earl himſelf curſt grey Hairs, griev'd he was born ſo ſoon; and to be again capable of loving, and fit to be belov'd, would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd the World's Empire, and that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which his Years had brought him. <hi>Enthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>'s looks ſpoke the agreeable diſorders of his Mind, and the charming Miſtreſs of his Heart had ſo much of a languiſhing ſoftneſs, and new born Love in her Eyes, they reach'd his very Soul, and hurry'd him into extaſie. The calm Evening added infinitely to their Pleaſure, nor did they think of parting till the falling Dew oblig'd them to't.</p>
                     <p>The Duke was already divided from himſelf, his thoughts were wholly imploy'd on the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of that Day, and he was ſurpris'd to find himſelf in <hi>Cluſa,</hi> when he had hardly dreamt of his being on the Road. To inform you how he ſpent the Night, were a needleſs labour, if you have been in Love, you can eaſily form his Pains, his Hopes, his Fears, and the ſtrange e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of his Soul; and if you have not, you would hardly credit the Recital; as for the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Eriphile, Albiſinda,</hi> I leave her to your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Judgment, doubtleſs you can Divine her Thoughts, and if you never was a Priſoner to reſiſtleſs Love, yet your fancy can eaſily paint her faint Joys, diſtant Cares, frequent Doubts, and diſorder'd Thoughts.</p>
                     <p>Next Morning the Duke was at Court, e're the King had quit his Bed, and waited the Earl's arrival, with the impatiency of a young Lover. When he came, <hi>Entheon</hi> upon the firſt occaſion told him how happy he was in being a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:179798:11"/> and ſmiling (ſaid he) <hi>Ciſala,</hi> ſure you need no more to make you Maſter of all your fellow Creatures, than to ſhew them what a Treaſure you can diſpoſe of. The Earl, who could ne're enough eſteem a Man of his Merit, was much pleas'd with this piece of Raillery (for ſo he would term it) and told him, the World was indeed pleas'd to commend his Daughter's Beauty, and that he was heartily ſenſible of the Honour he did him, in heightning her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. For his good Opinion muſt needs be much to the advantage of a young Lady, ſince no Man refus'd to pay homage to his Judgment and Choice in every thing elſe: From this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute let me date their Friendſhip. The Earl was no where to be found, but with the Duke; and <hi>Entheon</hi> muſt be ſued to by <hi>Ciſala.</hi> The Lover thought <hi>Cluſa</hi> no other than a Deſart, or if a Ball at Court ſometimes oblig'd his Miſtreſs to wait upon the Queen, he judg'd himſelf in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World. He found a livelier Air in every Man's Face, and the tranſports of his elevated Soul were ſuch, that with difficulty he abſtain'd from giving publick Teſtimonies of his inward ſatisfaction. The happy <hi>Eriphile</hi> ey'd him with concern, thankt the gods for the bleſſing of his Love, and knew no real Cares, but when ſhe dreamt ſhe did not pleaſe enough. The Duke became the Object of her ſerious Wiſhes, and he ne're petition'd Heaven without a Clauſe for her. Thus ſome Months were conſum'd, Love was an equal Friend to both, and mutual hopes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd their growing flames. Each of them fear'd the loſs of the other, and the Duke having obtain'd the Earl's conſent, Hymen could not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:179798:12"/> be wanting in his. In a word, they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd.</p>
                     <p>I hope, <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> you'll excuſe me, if for the firſt Night I draw the Curtain, and hide her Maiden bluſhes, when the haſty Youth took her in his Arms, trembl'd with the apprehenſion of his coming Joy, ſpoke in ſoft whiſpers, yet ſcarce knew what he ſaid, and the beating of his Heart expreſt the eagerneſs of his Soul. When breathleſs on her panting Breaſts he lay, ſtrove to be again bleſt, and again ſunk beneath the weight of the exceſſive Pleaſure; or better to expreſs it, when Love (too prodigally kind) gave him Heaven by the bulk, without a ſtrength of Mind adapted to the Bleſſing. To paint the Joys of both were too much, let this ſuffice, <hi>They lov'd, and were marry'd with conſent of Friends.</hi> The Days now ſeem'd Hours, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſſer Scenes of happineſs than the more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Night; and in the morning (tho' divided) each of them thought they yet felt the faſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of the other, and could hardly think themſelves unlockt; ſo vigorouſly had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Soul's paſt Joys imprinted it ſelf upon the conſenting active Body. But this fair Weather was not of perpetual Duration, a Cloud hover'd in the Air, thickned on a ſudden, and in time eclips'd the ſhining happineſs of both.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fidelia,</hi> a Lady whoſe Wit and Humour had made her (from a mean Station) the exalted Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of a kind Monarch, had come (as uſually ſhe did once a Day) to ſee the young Dutcheſs. They were both addicted to gaming (a Diverſion, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſinda,</hi> rarely known to the Ladies of your
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:179798:12"/> Country) and having plaid ſome time at Cards, they reſolv'd to viſit the <hi>Centura,</hi> (with us call'd a Play-houſe) where deſiring to paſs <hi>Incognito,</hi> they dreſt for the purpoſe, and a little after the Play was begun, they appear'd in the ſide Boxes. Their Cloaths and Air drew the Eyes of a full Audience, and the Actors themſelves were ſo much ſurpris'd, they ſcarce remember'd one Cue of twenty, and were oblig'd to the care of the Prompter for every Sentence they ſpoke, who himſelf had been incapable of rendering that timely Service, if his Seat had fronted either the Stage or Pit. The moſt daring of the <hi>Beaus</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, and tho' they judg'd them of Quality, yet ſince they were Maskt, they thought that, without being guilty of ill manners, they might attacque them. Amongſt thoſe the Duke ſhew'd himſelf none of the leaſt forward, and <hi>Fidelia</hi> (who was freer than the more modeſt <hi>Eriphile)</hi> was the one he aſſaulted; ſhe fail'd not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain him kindly, and the Dutcheſs (who would not baulk the Adventure ſo oddly begun) took up with the firſt that offer'd himſelf. He was a handſom Youth, and knew how to addreſs a Lady as well as any Man in the World. The Dutcheſs was very well pleas'd with his Wit and Converſation, ſhe already lov'd this inviſible way of intriguing, and thought it within a degree of goddeſsſhip to be pray'd to unſeen. The Duke (who was young and naturally amorous) ſpent the hours very agreeably, and form'd a Beauty to himſelf like that of his fam'd <hi>Eriphile,</hi> yet propos'd only this ſatisfaction to himſelf, that to ſee her robb'd of modeſty would ſerve to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:179798:13"/> that which himſelf poſſeſt, with conſtant Virtue joyn'd.</p>
                     <p>When the Curtain was dropt, the Dutcheſs ey'd <hi>Fidelia,</hi> as if wholly ignorant what to do; ſhe had rely'd on her; and ſhe (who was all Gaiety and Mirth, and knew well enough how to come off) gave the Duke her Hand, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeated themſelves in the Coach, drove to ſome noted Tavern not far off. When they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the Room, the Duke humbly begg'd the Lady would unmask, <hi>Erinthus</hi> (for that was his Name who waited upon the Dutcheſs) did the ſame, and both their unknown Miſtreſſes were almoſt forc'd to cry out in their own defence, or chuſe to undergo a quick diſcovery; but our Gallants perceiving they were obſtinate, were at laſt fatisfied with their Fortunes. 'Twas an odd freak on both ſides, and enough to move any Man's ſmiles, had he ſeen how earneſtly they talkt, ſwore, prais'd and lov'd what yet they had not ſeen. The Duke was charm'd with the wit of his unknown Miſtreſs, and <hi>Eriphile</hi> felt thoſe emotions which ſhe ne're had known, but when ſhe firſt ſaw the godlike <hi>Entheon.</hi> At laſt they betook themſelves to Cards, where (at <hi>Pickquet) Erinthus</hi> won fifty Pieces from the Dutcheſs; ſhe readily paid him, and this confirm'd him in what he almoſt before believ'd, that ſhe was of Quality. This put him upon his guard, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd him with care to pleaſe; he aſſum'd a new Air, and ſhew'd ſo much it ſeems of Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that the yielding <hi>Eriphile</hi> was perfectly charm'd.</p>
                     <p>The Clock at laſt (having ſtruck twelve)
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:179798:13"/> ſounded a Retreat, and they began to think of their reſpective concerns. The Lovers begg'd they'd allow them the Honour of waiting upon them to their Lodgings; 'twas readily granted, and the Coach being call'd, 'twas as readily put in Execution. The Dutcheſs had given the Coach-man private Orders to drive to her Houſe, and the Duke, whoſe mind was much imploy'd, ne're examin'd the place till he found himſelf in his own Bed chamber. As he was about to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his ſurpriſe, <hi>Eriphile</hi> and <hi>Fidelia</hi> unmaskt. <hi>Erinthus</hi> firſt begg'd Pardon for his rude miſtake, and <hi>Entheon,</hi> (after he had rouz'd his diſorder'd Judgment) ſmil'd, and askt the Dutcheſs if what he had done, gave her any cauſe to ſuſpect his Faith, and hop'd <hi>Fidelia</hi>'s Wit excus'd him for ſpending ſo much time in her Company, when he had thought his Wife at home. <hi>Eriphile</hi> ſmil'd too, and faintly anſwer'd, if <hi>Fidelia</hi> pleaſe ſhe can eaſily Charm, for Wit and Beauty joyn'd can ne're aſſault a generous Heart in vain. The Duke was ſurpris'd with this cold return, and 'tis certain the lovely Dutcheſs ne're had us'd him ſo before; ſhe was not now Jealous, nor had ſhe any Reaſon to fear the loſs. But <hi>Erinthus</hi> already appear'd too Charming, and truth is, it ſeems he had ſomething about him very taking, and ſingularly agreeable, for he had before that time atack'd a Lady of the ſame Rank, and had not fail'd of the ſucceſs deſir'd.</p>
                     <p>You may wonder perhaps, <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> why I am not more particular in my Character of this Man; but to ſatisfie ſome part of your Curioſity, know, he owes his Birth to <hi>Burgoa,</hi> a Common-Wealth rais'd by Trade, their induſtry, and the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:179798:14"/> eaſineſs of their prouder Neighbours, to a height unlookt for, ſurmounting in Wealth thoſe very States or Kingdoms, from whom ſome Years ago they kneeling begg'd Protection. Love and Gallantry are Strangers to the Nation, many of their Souls are as Phlegmatick as their Bodies, and moſt of them look like Machines or rather walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tuns. His Parents were forc'd to purſue a mean imployment to purchaſe a livelihood, and the now fortunate Lover, when young, left his Country in a Poſt ſuitable to his Quality and Education. But having learnt in <hi>Armenis</hi> (what was by no means to be found at home) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a better Air, and the eaſie ſmooth way of ſpeaking peculiar to the Language of that more Polite Nation, he quickly found Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They are naturally kind enough to Strangers, and the advantages of his Perſon (which Nature it ſeems deſign'd not for a <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goan)</hi> conduc'd not a little to his good Fortune. That he was a lucky Gameſter may appear from this, that in a very ſhort time he purchas'd an Eſtate, and became a Companion to thoſe of the beſt Quality in <hi>Sindalon. Entheon</hi> us'd gaming as a wiſe Man ought to do, that is, for his Pleaſure; he always play'd without Heat, loſt Cheerfully, and rarely laid down too much to be diſpos'd of by Fortune, remembring always how much of madneſs it ſhew'd, to put that to a hazard which before was his own.</p>
                     <p>This accidental meeting already mention'd, gain'd him the Honour of the Duke's acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; you may believe then, <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> that for the future he was no ſtranger to his Houſe; they ſpent whole Days together, and Night her ſelf
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:179798:14"/> could ſometimes hardly part them. <hi>Eriphile</hi> was always pleas'd when he was preſent, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd for his abſence. 'Tis true, her Virtue was yet ſtrong, and ſhe ſtruggl'd with the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſſion, hid her griefs with Art, and in her Eyes expreſt an eaſier Soul. When ſhe play'd, her thoughts even then were hardly fix'd on Game, nor could ſhe truely grudge the fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Erinthus</hi> a double Victory.</p>
                     <p>The Youth already obſerv'd his coming hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and by his induſtry to pleaſe, advanc'd that Heaven he wiſh'd for. 'Tis impoſſible, when alone to expreſs her pains, ſhe ſaw how much ſhe lov'd, and from her yielding Heart could judge her Honour loſt. <hi>Entheon</hi> ſtill was kind, ſhe knew his Merit, and fain would yet be juſt; but powerful Love, with double force aſſails, and ſcatters virtue's Charms that ſtop his way. Nor can he walk with Judgment who was always Blind.—Oh <hi>Albiſinda!</hi> that this charming Fair, at laſt betray'd her Marriage Vows, is not be diſputed. But to ſay, ſhe fell without a noble Conteſt, were too much. No Woman e're knew more, or was Miſtreſs of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Inclinations, ſhe was ſenſible of her Errour, even when ſhe drew the Guilt upon her; and in his Arms (although ſhe lov'd) could have wiſh'd her Soul fled to ſave her ſinking Honour. The World has more than common Charity for the fair <hi>Eriphile,</hi> and ſome People ſcruple not to affirm, ſhe yielded e're ſhe knew ſhe had done ſo. The Story, <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> is in this place known to all, and (even by thoſe who pretend to an exact knowledge in the ſtate of Affairs relating
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:179798:15"/> relating to this amour) for a truth believ'd. And it runs thus,</p>
                     <p>The Duke it ſeems had long profeſt a more than common tenderneſs for the lovely <hi>Daria,</hi> a Maid generouſly educated, and of a noble Spirit, to her Miſtreſs juſt, nor to her ſelf unkind. No allurements could prevail, no preſent found ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and the weakneſs of her Nature was always ſupported by the ſtrength of her Virtue. But the Duke growing at laſt importunate, and obſtinately kind, ſhe found it too hard to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Honour and his Friendſhip too. In this preſſing juncture ſhe reſolv'd to abandon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and after ſhe had with Tears in her Eyes told the Dutcheſs, that an affair of Conſequence required her abſence, humbly begg'd ſhe'd make her happy in her Conſent.</p>
                     <p>Her Miſtreſs was too ſenſible of her Merit, to loſe her without Reluctancy, and ſaid to her, that if ſhe was any way diſoblig'd ſhe ſhould have immediate ſatisfaction; nor would ſhe give her Conſent, unleſs ſhe were firſt acquainted with thoſe Reaſons that mov'd her departure. <hi>Daria</hi> wept, and on her Knees conjur'd her not to urge, what if betray'd would give her Pains unknown. This inſtead of ſatisfying, encreas'd the Dutcheſs Curioſity, and ſhe was at laſt oblig'd to diſcloſe the whole.</p>
                     <p>Poor <hi>Eriphile</hi> was Thunder-ſtruck with the unwelcome Relation. Her Heart 'tis true alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was unfix'd, and ſhe had thoſe thoughts for <hi>Erinthus,</hi> which ſpoke him too much Maſter of her Soul. Yet ſhe lov'd the nobler <hi>Entheon,</hi> or at leaſt eſteem'd him ſo much, that ſhe could
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:179798:15"/> not even in thought conſent to loſe him. In this afflicting affair her Wit or Invention at laſt offer'd this relief, which ſhe propos'd as the only means to confirm the Duke her own, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her <hi>Daria</hi> too. The Maid was ſeemingly to yield, to make an aſſignation, and that done ſhe was to leave what follow'd to <hi>Eriphele</hi>'s Care and Management. This was as ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd as projected, for the faithful Maid (whoſe Beauties were better'd by her new Griefs) was that Day more ſtrongly aſſaulted than ever, and ſhe could do no leſs than make an Appointment. Two in the Morning was the hour agreed upon, and you may eaſily believe <hi>Entheon</hi> thought it an Age till Night. In the Afternoon <hi>Erinthus</hi> came to ſee him, of whoſe Company he was at that time more than ever deſirous. To Cards they went, where the pleaſures of Love were for a while forgot, and Game and Wine the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of both.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the Dutcheſs (willing to enjoy what was for her Maid deſign'd) took poſſeſſion of <hi>Daria</hi>'s Bed, and with much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency waited the Duke's coming. The hour at laſt appear'd, but <hi>Entheon</hi> (whither indiſpos'd by drinking, ſudden conſcientious qualms, or ſitting up beyond his uſual hour, I know not) felt no great inclination to the Combat. This freak, <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> is indeed unanſwerable, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if you weigh the Conduct of this great Man; but 'tis confidently affirm'd that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <hi>Erinthus</hi> with the Intrigue. Told him, he found himſelf at that time unfit for the Field, and that if he pleas'd, he might ſupply his Place. The forunate Youth was raviſh'd with the kind
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:179798:16"/> offer, and told the Duke, that ſince he was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fight for the firſt Blood, he was proud of the ſervice enjoyn'd him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In ſhort, <hi>Entheon</hi> conducted him to the Chamber door, which ſtood open on purpoſe for himſelf, and there left him.</p>
                     <p>The Youth found the Bed in the dark, and I ſuppoſe (without the help of a Candle) found the Dutcheſs too. She receiv'd him, as ſhe'd have done her Husband, and if ſhe found him richer in his Love, ſhe attributed the Cauſe to liberal Fancy, that form'd her new, and of a ſtale Wife made a tender young Miſtreſs. How e're it was, they remain'd not long in the ſtate of Ignorance, and each of them wonder'd why the other was ſilent; for tho' <hi>Erinthus</hi> would paſs for <hi>Entheon,</hi> and <hi>Eriphile</hi> would for a time be <hi>Daria,</hi> yet the firſt Joys and tranſports fled, ſhe began to diſtinguiſh the Lover from the Husband, and trembling ſaid, My dear <hi>Enthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> why have you us'd me thus? I have been <hi>Daria,</hi> and under that Name much happier than my own. Ev'n when ſhe ſpoke ſhe doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the truth, and us'd theſe words, only to be confirm'd in her Opinion. The Lover was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd, the place on a ſudden was converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a new Heaven, and he only griev'd, that much of his paſt Happineſs was loſt, by being ſo long ignorant of the value of that treaſure he had poſſeſs'd. New Love, new Wiſhes, rouze him up to Life, and e're he ſpoke he would be bleſt again. <hi>Eriphile</hi> 'twixt fear and hope again receiv'd him, and even in his Arms could hardly know whether ſhe wiſh'd him <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theon</hi> or not.</p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:179798:16"/>
                     <p> At laſt the fortunate Youth confeſs'd himſelf, told her that Chance and the Duke's kindneſs had made him happy, but ſhe alone could keep him in that ſtate. That he had long ador'd her, and bountiful love had now repay'd his pains; that his happineſs ſhould be conceal'd from all the World, and her Honour was now as ſecure, as if in <hi>Entheon</hi>'s Arms ſhe fainting lay. A Crime when firſt committed is of greateſt weight, and frequent repetitions render thoſe things familiar and ſeemingly innocent, which we at firſt view'd with reluctancy and horror, for a ſmall ſin paſt without grief, ſpeaks us in a fair way towards a greater. The Dutcheſs 'tis true lov'd, and by his Voice knew the happy Man: But then ſhe remembred the loſs of her honour, ſaw how far ſhe had fall'n, and trembled when ſhe look'd back upon the frightful Precipice. She call'd to mind the Duke's paſt Love, thoſe thoughts ſhe had for him, when firſt he ſound her lying in the Grove, and knew his merit nothing yet dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd. This my dear <hi>Albiſinda</hi> gave the Fair One ſome pains, for tho' her Nature had given conſent, her Soul was yet Virtuous; and had <hi>Erinthus</hi> ſeen thoſe Tears ſhe ſhed, all thoughts of Joy had vaniſh'd from his Breaſt, grief had diſarm'd his eager wiſhes, and impotency by pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty brought, had ſupply'd the place of vigorous Love. But, <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> 'twas in the dark, the Curtains drawn, they were alone, both lov'd and both forgot their Cares; you may eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he had his ſhare; for tho' he was a <hi>Burgoan</hi> that is, a Man whoſe Conſcience would never baulk his buſineſs, if attended with pleaſure or profit, yet he had ſome faint remembrance of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:179798:17"/> that injuſtice he did to a Man, who had forgot his mean Birth, made him a Companion and ſharer in his pleaſures, and had (or at leaſt thought ſo) beſtow'd that Prize upon him, (in the ſeeeming poſſeſſion of <hi>Daria)</hi> which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had ſought for many Months. In a word, all complaints were huſh'd; the Dutcheſs forgot what once ſhe was, what yet ſhe ought to have been, and own'd her Love was ſtronger than her Virtue.</p>
                     <p>When the Youth retir'd, her Cares again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd, ſhe griev'd a loſs ſhe could not then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve, and wept and wiſh'd the buſineſs ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. Theſe indeed were the firſt motions of her primitive Soul; but Love again brought it to a modern Conſtitution, ſhe conſider'd how ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely ſhe had enjoy'd the Man ſhe lov'd, and flatter'd her ſelf with the thoughts of being real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly innocent, becauſe the World yet thought her ſo, and believ'd the manner in which it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed extenuated the Crime. In the mean time, the Duke had waited the return of his Friend, (if now I may call him ſo) and ſmiling ask'd, how happy he had been. <hi>Erinthus</hi> gave him a thouſand thanks for that Teſtimony he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd of his Friendſhip, but told the Adventure with ſo much indifferency, that <hi>Entheon</hi> could hardly grudge that favour he had beſtow'd upon him. When he went to Bed, he was yet inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his loſs, <hi>Eriphile</hi> was all lovely, and that Crime againſt his Love he had almoſt committed, endear'd the Object of his wiſhes more, than all her wonted Charms, or native goodneſs. He found her melancholy greater than uſual, and griev'd that ſhe was not ſo kind as ſhe uſed to be,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:179798:17"/> earneſtly ask'd the cauſe, and to comfort her, ſwore, that he had that Noble Love for her, which our firſt Father bore to his lovely <hi>Eve,</hi> e're Hell debauch'd her. She gave him feign'd returns, alledg'd ſhe was indiſpos'd, begg'd his Pardon for her ſeeming indifferency, and faintly ſaid, ſhe did belive he Lov'd her. The kind Duke was ſatisfied, and in a few Minutes the Cares of both were ſwallowed up in ſleep.</p>
                     <p>This account, <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> is by ſome rejected, and your buſie Medlers, or News-pimps, who pretend to know every thing, confidently affirm, that <hi>Erinthus</hi> had won ſo much from her at Cards, ſhe was neceſſarily oblig'd to pay the Sum with a favour that might have been the price of Empire.</p>
                     <p>Next day he came to wait upon the injur'd Duke (or rather the kind Dutcheſs) and forgot not to improve every opportunity to the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his Love. In a little time he became too happy, or at leaſt too often ſo; and if the generous <hi>Entheon</hi> had in the leaſt ſuſpected the Fair <hi>Eriphile</hi>'s weakneſs, or his Friendſhip, their guilt had been too obvious. His Noble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence made him too ſecure, till an Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that hapened ſome time after, taught them more caution, and him more of Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</p>
                     <p>The Duke it ſeems was oblig'd to attend the King, who then kept his Court twenty Miles from <hi>Cluſa.</hi> The Dutcheſs knew of it the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Night, and had therefore order'd every thing neceſſary for the reception of her Lover. Her Husband took Coach about Eight next Morning, and <hi>Erinthus</hi> was to wait upon her
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:179798:18"/> Grace at three in the Afternoon. She thought every hour had borrow'd from Eternity, and griev'd ſhe had delay'd her happineſs ſo long. She ſighing lay upon the yielding Bed, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Modiſh covert of a ſudden indiſpoſition, occaſion'd by a Cold ſhe ne're had felt, avoided the unſeaſonable Viſits of her troubleſome Friends. <hi>Daria</hi> was alone privy to the intrigue, and tho' ſhe had all that reſpect for the Dutcheſs, which her Duty in the ſtricteſt ſenſe could exact from her; yet ſhe griev'd to find her Virtue ſo much weakned, and wiſh'd her innocent as when firſt ſhe knew her. <hi>Eriphile</hi> had the goodneſs to excuſe her ſelf as handſomely as ſhe could, Painted her Lover dreſt with all his graces about him, and ſhow'd the power of ſubtle Love, in words that ſpoke her knowing in the Myſtery. Poor <hi>Daria</hi> ſigh'd as if ſhe had felt thoſe pains of which her Miſtreſs ſpoke, and by her looks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd her inward griefs. The Dutcheſs careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerv'd her frequent change of colour, and the fluſhing of her diſorder'd Blood, and ask'd, if Love had ever led her Captive. The tender Maid bluſh'd, and by her ſilence confeſt the truth of what her Miſtreſs had often much ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. She charg'd her upon her allegiance, as ſhe would preſerve her eſteem, and make her think ſhe lov'd her, ſhe would relate the whole and by the ſtory of her Love divert her melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, till the arrival of the fortunate <hi>Erinthus. Daria</hi> excus'd her ſelf from the performance as well as ſhe could; but ſeeing 'twas not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceepted, ſhe ſigh'd, was ſome minutes ſilent, and addreſſing her ſelf to the Dutcheſs, began as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

                     <p>YOU know, Madam, I was born in <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronida,</hi> your ſiſter Nation and of the ſame Religion with your ſelves, a hardy Warlike Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet no Strangers to Love, and tho' we lye North from <hi>Armenis,</hi> and by our bounds make up the half of the Iſland, yet we ſeem nearer the Torrid Zone than you. My Father was a Gentleman very much eſteem'd, and tho' his Fortune did not prefer him to that height his Soul always aim'd at, yet his humour and agreeable Converſation, made him the darling of his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Neighbours, and he match'd with an ancient Family rich in Friends, and every way truly preferable to his own. I was the firſt and laſt pledge of their Loves, and was ever doated upon by thoſe who ſaw me, for that reſemblance <hi>I</hi> had of the Fair <hi>Julietta,</hi> (for that was my Mother's name) and <hi>Ariſteon</hi> (my kind Father) eſteem'd his Young Daughter even beyond Life or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. He ſought Wealth only to bleſs me in a Noble Marriage, and with ſecret Pride already ey'd my growing Beaury. Our Neighbour in the Country, the great <hi>Dion,</hi> who (tho' a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Gentleman) can for the ſervice of his Prince muſter an Army of his own Vaſſals and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, to the number of ſome thouſands, had a Son whom all the World eſteem'd, whom many Beauties ſigh'd for, and none attackt with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. I was then in the ſixteenth Year of my Age, and tho' I had often ſeen him and heard him prais'd, yet my Heart had ne're ſubmitted to his Charms.</p>
                     <p>That Friendſhip which was between my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his, drew them often together, and the generous <hi>Dion</hi> has ſometimes ſpent whole Weeks
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:179798:19"/> at our Houſe. It hapened once, that while he rode a Hunting, and eager in the Chaſe, his Horſe fell down a ſloping Bank, and bruis'd his hardy Rider. <hi>Ariſteon</hi> was much concern'd for this Misfortune, and immediately ſent for his Son. The handſom Youth came to our Houſe with Tears in his Eyes, and mourn'd over his Aged Father, with the tenderneſs of a weeping. Mother, that griev'd the loſs of her darling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant. There was ſo much of the Man mixt with a Woman's ſoftneſs in his pains, that I could not chuſe but obſerve it. I was inſenſibly pleas'd with every word he ſpoke, and ſighing wiſh'd I had had a Brother like him. His Cares for the old Man brought mine, and I could have wept for <hi>Dion,</hi> more earneſtly than when firſt he got his Wounds. The Young <hi>Odmar</hi> (for ſo he was call'd) took notice of my Cares, and from my Tenderneſs and Compaſſion, argu'd the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my Soul. I ſhall not, Madam, praiſe my own Beauty; but he has afterwards told me, that the ſoftneſs I then ſhow'd, reach'd his Heart, and from ſmall griefs wound him to Pity, and tho' he had no cauſe much to ſorrow for me, yet my pains to him ſhow'd double, and from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion drew him up to Love.</p>
                     <p>I was one evening walking in the Garden, diſorder'd in my thoughts, and examining my ſelf to find if that uneaſineſs I knew proceeded from my Love to <hi>Odmar.</hi> But as I began the ſcrutiny, he enter'd, who alone could confirm the truth of what I fear'd. I trembl'd as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd, wiſh'd him gone, yet lov'd to ſee him ſtay, and ſcarce could tell what thoughts poſſeſt my Heart. The Lovely Youth ſoon apologiz'd
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:179798:19"/> for intruding upon my Retirement, and you may eaſily imagine how readily I forgave him.</p>
                     <p>There was a pleaſant River at the back of the Garden-wall, and beyond that a ſpacious Green, where feeding Flocks attend the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s call, forget their preſent wants, and liſten to the lov'd Muſick of his tuneful Pipe. There labouring Swains when toils out-ſtrip the Day, Dance with the Maids they Love, and cheat thoſe pains by cruel labour brought. The Gard'ner it ſeems had by chance left the Back-door open, and there being a Tarraſs walk upon the top of the Bank, we reſolv'd from thence to view the open Fields. The Water murmur'd beneath us, and the little Fiſhes wanton'd in the Streams. The ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sun lookt back on that vaſt trackt he had left behind him, griev'd to loſe that proſpect once he had, and as he ſtoop'd beneath the veil of Night, rouz'd up himſelf with eagerneſs, and by a flaſh of new born Light, would gild the diſtant Mountains. Juſt ſo a Lover when he quits the Shoar, with trouble views the Miſtreſs of his Vows, longs to be nigh, yet ſtill he ſlides away, and when he's almoſt baniſh'd from her ſight, he ſtands aloft and glads her from afar, and by his geſtures ſhows he fain would ſtay. In a word, Madam, the place and the Company very much charm'd me, and I felt that painful joy at my Heart, which ſpeaks us ſick with Love. Amongſt other things, I askt <hi>Odmar,</hi> if his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's pains were yet abated, if he hop'd a ſpeedy recovery, and told him, that tho' I was proud of his Company, yet I could not chuſe but grieve the occaſion that brought us ſo often together.

                        <hi>Madam,</hi> reply'd he) <hi>I cannot be ſo happy in this World, as when I am in</hi> Ariſteon<hi>'s Houſe, and yet I think it fatal to me, for as the Father's pains decreaſe, the Sons are ſtill augmented, and thoſe torments that oppreſt the old Man's body, are doubly charg'd upon the young Man's Soul.</hi> I bluſh'd as he ſpoke, and ſo many crowding thoughts fill'd my Breaſt, I was unable from the confus'd heap to produce one to ſerve the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent exigency. My unſeaſonable ſilence ſhew'd I underſtood his Language too well, and had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought of (nay it may be wiſh'd for) what I heard.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Odmar</hi> read his good Fortune in my Eyes, and (willing to make uſe of the lucky Minute) threw himſelf at my Feet, conjur'd me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that his Life and Fortune depended on what I was about to ſay, that one kind word gave him Heaven, and my anger made him the unhappieſt of Men. That 'twas impoſſible for him to live without me, and he'd forfeit every thing he held dear on Earth, for the greater bleſſing of my Love.—His fears, Madam, were vain, I eſteem'd him too much to give him more of Pain, and reply'd in Terms that ſpoke him not indifferent to my Soul. Had your Grace ſeen his looks, when he found me ſo calm, in ſpite of all your Modeſty you would have doated on him, and I dare ſay 'twas impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Woman to have us'd him otherwiſe than I did.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dion</hi> at laſt recover'd, and I muſt ſay, tho' I wiſh'd him well, I griev'd his Health reſtor'd, 'cauſe by his abſence I was robb'd of <hi>Odmar.</hi> Our parting yet preſents it ſelf to my view, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:179798:20"/> I ſee the lovely Youth drown'd in Melancholy, aſham'd of his weakneſs, yet weeping as he ſpoke. His Houſe was but three Miles from ours. I bid him remember <hi>that</hi> Conveniency, and propos'd an Enterview at leaſt once a Week. The Youth (who was o rejoy'd to find me ſo kind, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent to his flame) was almoſt dumb with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, and ſwore he ne're could Merit any part of that Goodneſs I had ſhown; and that his Life was not of worth enough to repay my ſtock of Love.</p>
                     <p>When he was gone, methought I yet ſaw him, heard him, felt his ſoft kiſſes, and gaz'd upon the <hi>Phantom.</hi> My tender Heart could hardly bear the burden of a long Weeks abſence. A thouſand times I trac'd the Tarraſs walk, and if from afar I eſpy'd ought that reſembl'd Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Kind, I long'd and wiſh'd it him. <hi>Odmar</hi> ſhar'd in ev'ry thought, and my Father's Houſe lookt runious, dead and decay'd, ſince the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the ſprightly Youth. I remembred every word he ſpoke, when firſt he ſwore he Lov'd, and cur'ſt the hour that took him from my Sight. I bluſh not, Madam, to ſay, no Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ever lov'd like <hi>Daria,</hi> and no Man e're me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited more than <hi>Odmar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To avoid Diſcovery, I was to meet him a Mile from our Houſe, the River already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd which run by the Garden, chalk'd out my way, and I went along upon the dewy Banks, and ſhaded from the Sun by ſpreading Oaks. When we met 'was impoſſible for either of us to expreſs our Joys: We gaz'd, ſigh'd, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd, as if our Souls had joyn'd; griev'd that time flew too faſt, and wiſh'd the Minutes Years.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:179798:21"/> What e're he ſaid was welcome to my mind, and tho' I liſtned to his Voice, with all the pleaſure of a raviſh'd Maid, yet I often broke the thread of his Diſcourſe, by asking a thouſand little kind yet inſignificant Queſtions, becauſe like him I'd ſhow how much I lov'd. Thus have we ſpent a few ſhort hours, then griev'd and parted, tho' never before we had fix'd the Day for our next Enterview. At this time we rail'd at Fortune and our Stars, and mourn'd we could not meet to ſtay for ever. But had we known the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill, we'd then have judg'd our ſelves truly happy.</p>
                     <p>My Father it ſeems had often miſs'd me, and found by conſtant Obſervation that I was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent twice every Week, and always at the ſame hours. He knew not at firſt what to think of this adventure, he dreamt not of <hi>Odmar,</hi> and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd much that I ſhould walk abroad alone. 'Tis true he had taken notice of my Melancholy, tho' ignorant of the Cauſe, and was now afraid that I began to humour that weakneſs of the mind, which ſo often proves fatal to the Beauty and the Judgment of its Slave, knowing that while we humble the mind too far, we ſink the body quite. But then again conſidering my Years, my few Cares (unleſs I lov'd) his and my Mother's kindneſs to me, he could hardly Credit that thought; to rid himſelf therefore of his doubts, he reſolv'd to watch me narrowly for the future, and in perſon make a true and wiſh'd diſcovery of the hidden ſecret.</p>
                     <p>The early Day drove on the yielding Night, and as the latter fled, the firſt in view appear'd, proud of the Conqueſt, and growing in his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:179798:21"/> ſtrength. The happier gods lay ſtretcht upon their Beds, and loath to riſe, rais'd up their awe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heads, look'd down, and ſhuffl'd by the thicker Clouds, to ſee if buſie mortals yet were ſtirring, but viewing the dark and ſolitary Globe, they ſhrinkt again beneath the covert of the Night half fled, and clos'd up the Gape of Heaven to wait the arrival of the marching Day. In a word, Madam, 'twas very early in the morning when <hi>I</hi> aroſe, and took that road which led me to my Love. My Father follow'd me ſo cloſe, that unſeen he poſted himſelf behind a Buſh, hard by that ſhade where gentle <hi>Odmar</hi> lay. When I appear'd, the Youth aroſe and caught me in his Arms. Oh welcome to my Breaſt, (he cry'd) my beauteous generous <hi>Daria!</hi> What Love can repay this favour, or what words expreſs my boundleſs Joy. When all the World ſleeps, we two are awake, and kind <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> robs her ſelf of reſt to eaſe her <hi>Odmar</hi> from the pains of abſence. <hi>Ariſteon</hi> who ſaw how fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly he embrac'd me, and diſtinctly heard every word he ſpoke, was ſtrangely ſurpris'd, and wiſh'd himſelf in the other World, that he might be inſenſible of that affront he already thought done him in this; and doubted not but I was born for his ruine, and the diſgrace of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He was a Man, Madam, rigorouſly good, and lov'd me very tenderly; from this you may eaſily imagine the troubles of his Mind, and with what difficulty he contain'd himſelf. While <hi>Odmar</hi> ſpoke, I had felt a ſudden trembling at my Heart, new-born fears oppreſs'd my eaſie Soul, and I was ſick with the apprehenſion of ſome coming danger, yet could not foreſee how,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:179798:22"/> or from whence the dreaded ill ſhould come The young Man was ſenſibly afflicted with the unlookt for change, threw himſelf at my Feet, and ſighing cry'd. <hi>O my</hi> Daria <hi>whence this new coldneſs to the Man that Loves you! You have been kind, I have been more happy and—A riſteon</hi> no longer doubting what before he much had fear'd, with fury in his looks eppear'd. He continued ſome time ſilent, his paſſion denying him the liberty of ſpeaking, or it may be he waited till his heat abated, and his judgment ſhould take place. My ſurpriſe, Madam, is not to be painted in words, and kind <hi>Odmar</hi> griev'd and look'd on me. My Father look'd ſtedfaſtly upon me, and taking me by the Hand, which eagerly he graſpt, he calmly but reſolv'dly ſaid, Well, well, <hi>Daria,</hi> you have undone your ſelf, and baniſh'd eaſe from me. My misfortune comes from that ſide from whence I leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected any unkindneſs, and <hi>Odmar</hi> wrongs that Man, that would have laid down his Life for his or <hi>Dion</hi>'s ſervice. Ah! Why did he ask? or why did you conſent? Iv'e no comfort now, but that the tender <hi>Julietta</hi> is yet ignorant of her Daughter's weakneſs. My Lover was ſo amaz'd, he knew not what to ſay. But falling on his Knees he embrac'd thoſe of <hi>Ariſteon,</hi> and at laſt ſwore by all the Powers above, he never yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd him any harm, and that his Daughter was Virtuous ev'n to a fault. But if innocent Love, or chaſt mutual flames were crimes, he own'd we both were guilty, and deſerv'd his anger. <hi>Daria</hi>'s Birth (continued he) is in nothing infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to <hi>Odmar</hi>'s; and if my Fortune ſurmounts hers, her Virtue turns the ſcale, and with her
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:179798:22"/> Beauty joyn'd, weighs more than <hi>Dion</hi>'s Wealth, or all the glorious riches of the <hi>Indies.</hi> My Father with Tears in his Eyes rais'd him from the ground, and again taking me by the Hand, Come, come, <hi>Daria,</hi> (ſaid he) theſe are fine Baits to catch Fools and ignorant eaſie Maids withal. <hi>Odmar,</hi> for your Father's ſake I ceaſe to reſent this injury as I ought, tho' you have hurt me in the moſt tender part. <hi>She has been kind, you have been happy:</hi> But neither of you ſhall be ſo again, and now you part for ever. This ſaid, he turn'd his face and mine away, and curs'd the hour brought <hi>Odmar</hi> to our Houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To have ſeen the afflicted Lover, (for I would look back) would have baffl'd all the Precepts of Philoſophy, and turn'd the ſtrongeſt Reaſon and moſt fortified Judgment into downright madneſs. My Soul was in a perfect frenzy, and I could have rail'd againſt Heaven and Nature, and damn'd that wanton ſlippery minute that gave me firſt a being.</p>
                     <p>When we came home, I retir'd to my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. To tell you my thoughts, Madam, were to undertake an imployment that yet would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract me. I conſider'd my loſs, my indiſcreet management, my poor Father's grief, and by his concern and Love for me, ſoon found, that I ought not to have done any thing of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence without his knowledge and conſent. I remembred his Tears, his ſilence by the way (for he had not ſpoke one word to me upon the Road) the words my Lover utter'd, which might give him juſt grounds to ſuſpect my frailty. But moſt of all <hi>I</hi> remembred my afflicted <hi>Odmar;</hi> methought <hi>I</hi> yet ſaw him ſpeaking to my Father, yet eying
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:179798:23"/> me, and ſcarce Maſter of his Judgment, ſo much for me he fear'd.</p>
                     <p>My Mother wonder'd ſhe had not ſeen me all that day, and enquiring for me of <hi>Ariſteon,</hi> ſhe was told I kept my Chamber, that he had ſpoke ſome things to me, which tho' not harſh in themſelves, yet had brought my Tears; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd her to aſſure me, that he was again pleas'd, and pardon'd what could not be recall'd, if for the future I forbore to offend in that kind. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lietta</hi> deſir'd he'd impart the cauſe of this little quarrel, and told him, ſhe was afraid he had been unjuſt to me, becauſe ſhe knew I dreaded to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him. Beſides, ſhe was confident my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture led me not to any thing, that in the leaſt look'd like diſobedience. My Father ſaid he knew 'twas ſo, and that he was ſorry for what he had ſaid. You ſee, Madam, he had the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of a Kind Parent, and the goodneſs of a Juſt Husband. He already forgot (as much as poſſible) what he had heard and ſeen; my Tears had melted him, and after he had ſeriouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd <hi>Odmar</hi>'s words, the hopes of finding me truly innocent yet chear'd his Soul, and by quick degrees had rais'd him up to better, kinder thoughts. To <hi>Julietta</hi> he was juſt in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment of what had brought her too many fears; and to ſhow the goodneſs of his humour, from my infancy <hi>I</hi> obſerv'd, that he had the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Young Lover for her, ſtudy'd to pleaſe, as if he yet courted her eſteem; ſhe was a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs and a Wife, and never griev'd without a conſtant ſharer.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe came to ſee me, ſhe found my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Head ſupported by my Arm, I was half
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:179798:23"/> aſleep, my ſorrows having wearied out my active thoughts, and burden'd yielding Nature; unwilling to awake me, ſhe was about to retire, when her haſty ſteps prevented all her cares, and rouz'd me till I ſtarted from my Lethargy. I doubted not but that <hi>Ariſteon</hi> had fully inform'd her of what had paſt, and throwing my ſelf at her feet, conjur'd her to believe me innocent, ſwore I ne're had yielded even in thought; that the gen'rous kind <hi>Odmar</hi> had a better opinion of my Virtue, than to think of, or propoſe a thing that would have given me cauſe eternally to hate him. That I was faulty in nothing but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing a Secret of that weight from my Father and her. But that I ſhould attone for that Crime by my future Conduct.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Julietta</hi> was much ſtartled with what ſhe heard, but being of a ready Wit, eaſily conceal'd her paſt ignorance, and pleaſantly ask'd me why <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſteon</hi> was incens'd againſt <hi>Odmar?</hi> If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd it (added ſhe) where was the Crime? Come, tell me all again, for I'm afraid your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was byaſs'd by his Paſſion when he inform'd me of the Adventure.—You may believe, Madam, I fail'd not to obey, and thereupon gave her a true account of every thing that concern'd my Love, and that diſcovery <hi>Ariſteon</hi> had made. While I told the Story I could obſerve ſtrange changes and alterations in her looks. By turns, ſhe ey'd me with concern, anger, fear, joy, and grief. However the relation once ended, ſhe threw her Arms about my Neck, wept with the ſudden tranſport of indulgent thoughts, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd me ſhe had fear'd much my weakneſs, 'cauſe I yet was Young. But that now all her fears
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:179798:24"/> were vaniſh'd, and ſhe believ'd me Virtuous. That <hi>Ariſteon</hi> had conceal'd from her what had hapned that day, yet had ſent her to inform me, that he forgave me all. This, Madam, gave me a double joy, and I could hardly forbear laughing when I conſider'd my paſt thoughts, my fears, and that ugly face my dejected fancy had given to my Fortune, and now ſaw that which <hi>I</hi> had induſtriouſly form'd to encreaſe my own pain, in half a minute vaniſh'd. I thank'd <hi>Julietta</hi> for her tenderneſs and that good opinion ſhe had of me, and juſt as I ſpoke <hi>Ariſteon</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd. He had left me in Tears, and the fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Nature made him impatient till in ſome meaſure he had reſtor'd my peace of mind. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> (ſaid he) you ſee I'm a kind Father, and tho' you have offended, I come to ſue for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and am pleas'd to confeſs I wrong'd you Come my Dear, for the future let us have no cauſe for juſt complaints from either ſide, and let m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> to her Honour or that of our Houſe. <hi>Ariſteon</hi> ſaid, that at firſt his fears were it may be too great, but now his mind was at reſt, and I could only keep him ſo by my ſolemn promiſe before <hi>Julietta,</hi> never to ſee <hi>Odmar</hi> or to Love him more. This, Madam, was a hard proof of my
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:179798:24"/> Obedience, and at firſt I was very much ſurpris'd with the propoſal. But ſuddenly remembring that 'twas no mortal ſin if I ſhould ſee my Lover afterwards; I gave the proof of allegiance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd, and engag'd never to converſe with him again, unleſs one or both of them were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                     <p>Thus, Madam, the ſtorm I ſo much fear'd blew over, my ſin of Love was forgot, and I abſolv'd for a performance of the penance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd me. How far I play'd the Penitent, you may eaſily judge by what follow'd in a very few days.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dion</hi> came to our Houſe (as he us'd to do) attended by two or three Servants. Methought I had a more than common intereſt in them, and could hardly forbear teſtifying ſo much to his very Slaves. I ey'd them with a paſſion that is not eaſily to be expreſt, for I cannot poſitively ſay that I hop'd for any thing from them, and yet my mind gave me, that <hi>Odmar</hi> had (it might be) ſpoke to ſome of them, and if he had not written to me, at leaſt commanded them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my Eyes, and afterwards inform him if there they ſaw any ſigns of Languiſhment or Sorrow for his abſence. In each of their Faces (for from my Window I could ſee them playing in the Court,) methought I read my own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, remembred that next night they would be with <hi>Odmar,</hi> yet were inſenſible of he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and almoſt dy'd with grief, when I thought the Dear Youth had not ſent me any Mark of his continued Love.</p>
                     <p>In this dejected humour I retir'd; left the old People together, and in the Garden ſought for
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:179798:25"/> eaſe where firſt I loſt it. <hi>Rigd,</hi> (for that was the Name of one of the Servants) follow'd at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and taking an Alley which croſs'd that in which I walk'd, he met me as if chance had led him. You may believe, Madam, I was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly enough ſurpris'd when he gave me a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſmiling told me, his Young Maſter had been Poſt to himſelf, if <hi>Dion</hi> had not prevented him. When I received it, I ſcarce knew what to ſay; and I muſt confeſs <hi>I</hi> had not Art enough to hide my inward Joy. Having opened it, <hi>I</hi> found theſe words:</p>

                     <p>The Lodge much reſembl'd a Pavilion, 'twas ſtor'd with Books and Pictures, and from the Window one might ſee three Rivers joyn into one Body; and falling from a mighty precipice in view, you'd thought they ſhak'd the very Floor on which you ſtood. The bubling and hollow noiſe of the greater ſtream provok'd your Melancholy, and fed the Lamp of Love. I had of late much frequented that place, <hi>I</hi> kept the Key my ſelf, and could not think of one more convenient for this ſtol'n enterview. 'Twas there <hi>I</hi> writ my Letter undiſcover'd, and there reſolv'd to meet my welcome Lover; my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone us'd to poſſeſs it, 'tis true; but on the other hand <hi>I</hi> remembred, that <hi>I</hi> had not ſeen him there for twelve long Months paſt. In a word, Madam, <hi>I</hi> thought the place very ſecure, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready wiſh'd the Night gone, that ſtood like a heavy Age between me and my happineſs. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought <hi>I</hi> already ſaw the tranſported Youth begging at my Feet, melting my Heart, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:179798:26"/> conquering as he ſpoke. <hi>I</hi> dreamt of nothing but <hi>Odmar,</hi> or if <hi>I</hi> awak'd <hi>I</hi> ſcarce knew that <hi>I</hi> did ſo, for the lovely Image was ſo ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, <hi>I</hi> knew not if my Judgment or my active Fancy form'd him.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Day</hi> appear'd, the morning mov'd ſo faintly, you'd thought the lingring <hi>Night</hi> had dar'd him to the Combat, and vow'd the ſole poſſeſſion of the Skies. <hi>I</hi> quit my Bed ſo early, that from my Chamber Window <hi>I</hi> could not deſcry any thing awake but my ſelf, a dead ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence reign'd in every part, and not one watchful Bird yet welcom'd in the light, the yielding Graſs lay cover'd o're with Dew, and the nodding Trees ſpoke Nature in a Slumber. To any but a Love-ſick Maid, this had been no other than a melancholy Scene, and <hi>I</hi> muſt own that even to my ſelf it appear'd no leſs. But from that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy my pleaſure grew; Love in abſence is naturally dejected and languiſhing, and <hi>I</hi> firmly believe (at leaſt <hi>I</hi> think <hi>I</hi> felt it ſo) that when we are alone, and ſad, the Fancy is ſtronger than when our Reaſon drives our Paſſions from our Breaſts, and hardens the Soul, which Love or Grief before had melted down and made pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant for any impreſſions.</p>
                     <p>While thus <hi>I</hi> ſtood and thought of <hi>Odmar</hi> and the coming Night, <hi>I</hi> could ſee, (tho' with ſome difficulty a Man on Horſe-back). <hi>I</hi> waited im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently till he approach'd, (for thoſe who Love much hope eaſe from ev'ry thing) and at laſt knew him to be <hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Odmar</hi>'s Servant. After <hi>I</hi> had askt concerning his Maſter's health, and told him that I'd awake ſome of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to let him in, <hi>I</hi> ſtole gently down Stairs
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:179798:26"/> my ſelf, and (changing my Voice to a ſharper Key) deſir'd to know if he had buſineſs with my Maſter? (meaning my Father) <hi>Riga</hi> (for 'twas he, and knew me not) anſwer'd no. He begg'd pardon for that diſturbance he gave the Family, and ſaid, he had loſt yeſterday ſome Papers of conſequence, and was ſure he had dropt them in our Houſe, and to his beſt knowledge the laſt time he had them was in <hi>Daria</hi>'s Chamber, when he waited upon his Maſter. This encreas'd my hopes, and <hi>I</hi> firmly believ'd 'twas a Plot of <hi>Od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>'s, and willing to be ſpeedily reſolv'd, <hi>I</hi> ask'd him (by way of a whiſper) if he had not a Letter for my young Miſtreſs. No, (ſaid he in a ſeeming Paſſion) from whom ſhould it come? Why (reply'd <hi>I)</hi> ſhe writ to <hi>Odmar</hi> yeſterday, and from him expected an Anſwer. Did ſhe! (cry'd he) <hi>I</hi> know nothing of the matter, <hi>I</hi> came out early in ſearch of my Paper, and am oblig'd by ſeven of the Clock to attend <hi>Dion,</hi> becauſe this Day he goes a Hunting with ſome of his Neighbours. But pray (added he in another tone) Sweet heart, if 'tis poſſible let me into <hi>Daria</hi>'s Chamber, for there I'm perſwaded <hi>I</hi> ſhall find my Papers. <hi>I</hi> was vex'd, and knew not what to make of this Adventure. If my Father had ſeen me <hi>I</hi> had been undone. The fellow told me he had no Letter for me, yet wanted to be in my Room, and ſpoke the ſtory of his Papers with ſo much gravity and earneſtneſs, that <hi>I</hi> could hardly doubt the truth of what he ſaid. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing nevertheleſs to betray my own weakneſs, <hi>I</hi> ſtill perſonated the Maid, and faintly told him that he might come ſoftly up Stairs, and ſtay at the Door till <hi>I</hi> had receiv'd her Orders. He fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:179798:27"/> and when <hi>I</hi> enter'd my Chamber <hi>I</hi> was even ſick with grief, <hi>I</hi> wonder'd much that <hi>Odmar</hi> had not written to me, and thought, if he eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had long'd to ſee me, he had ſlipt no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of telling me ſo, and of returning thoſe thanks my too obliging Letter well deſerv'd. However <hi>I</hi> was yet unwilling to condemn him, and to divert that pain the thoughts of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs brought me. <hi>I</hi> run immediately to the Door, where <hi>I</hi> had almoſt forgot the poor Servant; and Night being wholly fled, he could perceive by my morning Gown who it was then admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and after a low Bow preſented me with a Letter from <hi>Odmar.</hi> I've loſt no Papers, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, (ſaid he) but you ſee I've preſum'd to bring one, and from a Man who would renounce a year of that term of life allotted him by Deſtiny, to ſee you as ſecurely now as <hi>I</hi> do. <hi>Riga</hi>'s good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and obliging Complement ſo prevail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my fluttering gladed Heart, that <hi>I</hi> could not for my life delay that. Reward he deſerv'd till <hi>I</hi> opened the Letter. The faithful Servant thankt me for my bounty, deſir'd me ſpeedily to read what he had brought me, and aſſur'd me <hi>I</hi> ſhould ever find him conſtant to his young Maſter's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, tho' <hi>I</hi> had not ty'd him to it by my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality. The words, Madam, If <hi>I</hi> remember well were theſe.</p>

                        <hi>I</hi> conſider'd this Letter as the effect of his Love, and the very product of his real Thoughts, and knew by his ſtile and freedom he had remembred 'twas in ſafe Hands, and would be with ſecreſie enough convey'd to mine. However, leſt the Servant's ſtay ſhould have render'd his Errand li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuſpicion <hi>I</hi> durſt not write, and only bid him tell his Maſter. <hi>I was pleas'd with what he had ſent me, but could give no immediate return, unleſs he hazarded a diſapointment at Night, as undoubtedly 'twould come to paſs, if I ſhould be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in the morning, of holding any correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with my kind</hi> Odmar. The Servant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and <hi>I</hi> could ſee him mount his Horſe er'e any in the Family were awake.</p>
                     <p>You may wonder, Madam, when you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my reſerv'd way of living, and coldneſs of Temper, how <hi>I</hi> was then ſo kind, and perhaps you may quarrel my fondneſs too, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion <hi>my kind</hi> Odmar! But if your Grace conſider my Years, and that my inclinations were Virtuous, methinks 'twill not appear ſtrange
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:179798:28"/> or faulty; for in honeſt exalted Love there can be no Crime, and what e're we ſay of obliging and tender, is certainly pardonable, if we do it as we ought, which in the firſt place is to conſider if we are truly belov'd, the merit and conduct of our Lovers, and moſt of all to do it privately and with caution; for even Crimes themſelves (when we confeſs the truth) if done in ſecret, give not half that trouble to the mind, which publick Trifles bring. <hi>I</hi> read the Letter a thouſand times, and in that imployment conſum'd the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Day. When the hour approach'd <hi>I</hi> felt thoſe little pains to which <hi>I</hi> had been a ſtranger, or at leaſt had not before that time thought of; <hi>I</hi> fear'd that if the Youth came too ſoon, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or ſome of the Servants might ſee him in the Fields, and if <hi>I</hi> ſhould go to the Lodge before the hour prefix'd, <hi>I</hi> ſhould be miſt and ſearch'd for. Theſe thoughts made me very uneaſie. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the danger <hi>I</hi> fear'd from the laſt Accident was the leaſt, and <hi>I</hi> ventur'd down into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. <hi>I</hi> had no ſooner opened the Door, than I found my haſty Lover muffled in his Cloak. The kind Youth caught me in his Arms. <hi>Oh my</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria! (cry'd he) <hi>I'm loſt in extaſie! Pardon me if I cannot expreſs my thoughts, to Heav'n and you I owe ſo much, that I muſt ſtill confeſs my ſelf a Bankrupt. O thou dear darling of my Soul, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me if I have no more this goodneſs to repay, but life and conſtant Love.</hi> He was ſo welcome to my Breaſt, Madam, that <hi>I</hi> could ſay no more than, <hi>Oh my</hi> Odmar! What <hi>I</hi> wanted in words <hi>I</hi> ſupply'd in looks, and <hi>I</hi> dare ſay the happy young Man was pleas'd with all he ſaw.</p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:179798:28"/>
                     <p> When we went into the Lodge <hi>I</hi> lockt the Door behind me; you ſee <hi>Odmar,</hi> (ſaid <hi>I)</hi> how much <hi>I</hi> Love, and the good opinion <hi>I</hi> have of you. Madam, (reply'd he) that's a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>I</hi> know not how to anſwer; for I'm afraid you'd think me faulty, if <hi>I</hi> ſaid your Honour were ſecure and you were ſafe, becauſe to mention that were to call my nobler Love in queſtion. No <hi>Odmar,</hi> (ſaid <hi>I) I</hi> would be very unhappy if <hi>I</hi> could in thought diſpute the innocence of your Love or Mine; but I'm ſorry that when <hi>I</hi> ſee you, <hi>I</hi> muſt be guilty of a breach of Promiſe. Ha, (cry'd he) is <hi>Ariſteon</hi> then ſo much an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to my Love! It ſeems he doubts not your Virtue but my Treachery. But <hi>Daria</hi> he's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt to me, for rather than wrong thee, I'd forfeit Life, Eſtate, or any thing yet dearer, nay by Heav'n I'd rather baniſh all my hopes of being Belov'd, never ſee thee more, and be for ever damn'd to abſence from my greateſt Bleſſing.—Yet <hi>Daria</hi> (for thou art all goodneſs) think of a way to redreſs this mighty ill, ſecure thy ſelf, and eaſe thy Father of his fears, and if you Love, tye your ſelf for ever mine. Oh my <hi>Daria!</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe me not that Heav'n <hi>I</hi> ask, our Parents ſoon will be reconcil'd, <hi>I</hi> ſhall yet (if poſſible) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe my ſtock of Love, thou ſhalt be more fond, and all that ſee us ſhall confeſs us truly happy.</p>
                     <p>Madam, <hi>I</hi> hope you will own 'twas hard for a young Maid, that lov'd well to keep a Medium 'twixt her Fears and Joys. His Fortune was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely beyond mine, he knew his Father would be incens'd, and might perhaps from a kind Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent become a cruel Enemy; all the World was ſenſible of his Merit, nor could he himſelf be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:179798:29"/> that 'twas in his power to wed a greater Beauty and a larger fortune. When theſe thoughts fled, my ſudden Cares took place, and <hi>I</hi> already ſaw him unfortunate and forſaken by his Friends, 'cauſe he was juſt to me. <hi>I</hi> ſaw his frowns in poverty, and an hourly decay in his Love; and methought <hi>I</hi> already heard the poor chang'd <hi>Odmar</hi> whiſpering in my Ear, <hi>I had been great, had I but lov'd thee leſs.</hi> This laſt thought ſtopt the haſty flight of my fond new fledg'd Soul, and it was not in my power to give an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to what the Youth had ſaid. My unuſual ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence equally mov'd his wonder and his fear, when throwing himſelf at my feet, <hi>Daria</hi> (ſaid he) why do you uſe me thus? Oh remember 'tis <hi>Odmar</hi> ſpeaks, 'tis the Man that Loves you, one that can ne're be happy without you, and thinks the Gods have not a gift to beſtow upon their firſt Fav'rite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Mortals, like that <hi>I</hi> ask of you. Who can reſiſt a kneeling Lover, Madam? I rais'd him in my Arms, and fondly, yet confus'dly told him, <hi>His Love and Honour made me wholly his, and I would be eternally rul'd by him. For now I gave my all into his hands.</hi> To tell you his Joy and the kind words he utter'd, were to renew the ſenſe of my misfortunes. No man e're ſaid more, no Woman e're believ'd more, or gave kinder yet more innocent returns, and no two Lovers e're confided more in one another, or were happier than we. When we had ſaid all we could, we unwillingly were ſilent, and gaz'd upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then began afreſh, prais'd, lov'd, doated, ſigh'd and languiſh'd. This happy Scene had baniſh'd all my Cares, <hi>I</hi> found my <hi>Odmar</hi> Juſt, and ſought no other Bleſſing.</p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:179798:29"/>
                     <p> At laſt my diſcreet Lover kindly told me 'twas paſt twelve, conjur'd me to forgive him, becauſe <hi>ſlipery Time</hi> had run away when he had ſeen his thoughts imploy'd. <hi>I</hi> was heartily vex'd that <hi>I</hi> had manag'd ſo ill; <hi>I</hi> ſaw how inconvenient 'twas for <hi>Odmar</hi> to travel at an hour ſo unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and yet knew my ſelf neceſſarily oblig'd to leave him. In this diſorder of thoughts I heard a noiſe in the Garden, and ſtealing ſoftly to the Window, <hi>I</hi> could diſcern my Father with one or two Servants, enquiring earneſtly of one another if they had yet ſeen me. <hi>I</hi> trembl'd when I heard my name pronounc'd, and my Lover was almoſt mad with grief becauſe he ſaw me ſo. At laſt they came to the Door, where they knock'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, and receiving no anſwer, concluded <hi>I</hi> was in ſome other place, either dangerouſly ill with a ſudden fit of ſickneſs, or by ſome other accident unknown. My Father, to be better ſatisfied, commanded them to break open the Door, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaid I might be there, yet faſt aſleep. But the Servants aſſuring him that 'twas impoſſible, conſidering the noiſe they had made; he was at laſt diverted from his reſolution. My Lover while this was acting, ſtood with his Sword in his hand ready to receive him, ſwore he had been once tamely robb'd of me, but wou'd be ſo no more; that he wou'd not attempt <hi>Ariſteon</hi>'s Life, but would ſecure my Peace, and carry me off in ſpite of all his followers; and <hi>I</hi> verily believe had my Father enter'd, <hi>I</hi> would have truſted to <hi>Od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>'s generoſity, and fled with him. As they went off, <hi>I</hi> heard <hi>Ariſteon</hi> cry, <hi>Oh Heavens! Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore my Daughter, or take back that wretched Life you gave me.</hi> Theſe words wounded my
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:179798:30"/> very Soul; and <hi>I</hi> had almoſt cry'd <hi>Your</hi> Daria <hi>is not loſt.</hi> However ſeeing his ſearch was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he retir'd to his Houſe, and there with my weeping Mother, waited the arrival of a new day.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time 'twas ſo dark (and being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally tim'rous) <hi>I</hi> durſt not go thorrow the Garden alone, nor could <hi>I</hi> take <hi>Odmar</hi> with me, leſt <hi>I</hi> had met <hi>Ariſteon</hi> or ſome of the Servants by the way. My Lover ſaw my troubles, knew they were upon his account, and bore an equal ſhare; I ſtifled my grief as well as I could, that <hi>I</hi> might leſſen his, and with a calm brow ask'd him what was my beſt courſe. <hi>I</hi> bid him at once conſult my Honour and my ſafety. And he, who never entertain'd a thought againſt either, ſaid he would be advis'd by me. But if I rely'd upon his Opinion or Judgment, I ſhould ſtay in the Lodge all night, he'd ſtay by me, and guard me while <hi>I</hi> ſlept. In the morning he would retire as early as <hi>I</hi> pleas'd. And that <hi>I</hi> could hardly ſatisfie <hi>Ariſteon</hi> concerning my Conduct, if <hi>I</hi> ſhould go home at that hour of the Night. <hi>Odmar</hi>'s Voice was to me, Madam, no leſs than an Oracle, and <hi>I</hi> knew him ſo good and juſt, <hi>I</hi> ſcrupl'd not to grant him any thing he ask'd. My ſilence ſhew'd <hi>I</hi> was reſolv'd to ſtay; and the glad Youth ſcarce knew how to thank me for <hi>my</hi> goodneſs, and that opinion <hi>I</hi> had of <hi>his,</hi> and ſwore he would not betray ſo much innocence to gain the firſt Beauty under Heaven, and the greateſt Empire on Earth: Having thus ſpent an hour or two, <hi>Odmar</hi> begg'd I'd go to Bed (for there was always one in the Room in which my Father often lay) that ſleep was neceſſary for the preſervation of my
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:179798:30"/> Health, which was dearer to him than his own Life, and aſſur'd me he would awake me e're the Sun aroſe. I was much concern'd at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and with ſome paſſion ask'd him if he thought my Love had baniſh'd native modeſty, or if he had advis'd me to ſtay with a deſign to attempt my Honour. The kind Youth fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Knees, and claſping mine, Swore by all the Gods he never meant me ill; <hi>Daria</hi>'s welfare and that of his Soul were equally his care, and if <hi>I</hi> deny'd him that aſſurance of my Love he begg'd, he would believe himſelf yet unhappy after all I had done for him. Why <hi>Daria,</hi> ſaid he, is <hi>Odmar</hi> a Common Lover? Is he not thy Husband? Let me hope our Hearts are Joyn'd, and ſure a few trifling Ceremonies ſerve not to confirm the tye before Heaven but our fellow Creatures, whoſe unbounded Paſſions muſt be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and reſtrain'd by Laws. To the Virtuous and good no force is needful, and <hi>I</hi> ſhall be juſt to thee, as <hi>I</hi> would expect mercy from the powers in Heaven when my laſt hour approaches.—O! Madam, 'tis needleſs to ſay any more, <hi>I</hi> Lov'd even to diſtraction, nor did he merit leſs. <hi>I</hi> yielded, and hid my bluſhes in his Breaſt; he was bleſt, nor could <hi>I</hi> think my ſelf unhappy. That ſleep he had at firſt propos'd was to both deny'd, nay was not wiſh'd or look'd for; we conſum'd the hours in each others Arms, and <hi>Jove</hi> ſat wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when he view'd our Joys.</p>
                     <p>When the unfortunate Sun appear'd, and lovely <hi>Odmar</hi> roſe, what agonies did my poor Soul know! He embrac'd me tenderly, but without one kind word leapt from the diſorder'd Bed. <hi>I</hi> already fear'd <hi>I</hi> had ſhown too much of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:179798:31"/> fondneſs, and that the Joys of that Night had cloy'd the appetite of his eaſie Soul. When he was dreſs'd, he came again to the Bed's ſide, took me in his Arms, ſigh'd, and ask'd me when he ſhould be bleſs'd again? With Tears in my eyes I told him <hi>I was his, and that now my happineſs depended upon his pleaſure. To morrow's night then</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>let me find my</hi> Daria <hi>here, doubt not my Love or honour;</hi> kiſs'd me again, and ſo quit the Room. Oh! Madam, if you knew thoſe cares oppreſs'd me when he was gone. <hi>I</hi> remembred how elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent he had been before I yielded, and now ſaw he had not one kind word to ſpare. His ſighs encreas'd my fears, and <hi>I</hi> had nothing to comfort me in this new affliction, but that laſt kiſs he gave me, which, notwithſtanding of his ſilence, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought did yet expreſs a conſtant tender flame.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>I</hi> opened the Door, <hi>I</hi> trac'd his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps on the Dew, and almoſt ſunk with the freſh remembrance of what had paſt. Go (ſaid <hi>I) Odmar</hi> go, and if thou art not ſo Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as <hi>I</hi> have judg'd thee, <hi>I</hi> know how to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd; my Death ſhall attone for my guilt, and thou ſhalt mourn the loſs of her that lov'd thee. As <hi>I</hi> ſpoke, <hi>I</hi> caſt my Eyes that way the Youth had gone, and ſaw my Father coming. <hi>I</hi> trembl'd ſo much as he approach'd, that my fears indeed were enough to betray the ſecret. Ha! <hi>Daria</hi> (cry'd he) is this the reward of a Father's care? Have <hi>I</hi> lov'd you to be the more eaſily betray'd by you, and is your Virtue and Honour fled beyond Redemption! my paſſion is not maſter of my Judgment, and I forbear to uſe you as I ought to do, tho' I've trac'd <hi>Odmar,</hi> and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:179798:31"/> ſaw him on the other ſide of the River. But take this for my poſitive reſolution, never ſee me more; ſince you obey'd not the inſtruction of a kind Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>I</hi> ſhall, nay <hi>I</hi> have forgot that ever I had a Daughter. I had ſpent the night in pleaſure, and the morning in Tears, ſo that I had not time to feign a ſtory to divert his Anger. I threw my ſelf therefore at his feet, and ſunk with grief, could hardly bid him think <hi>I yet was Virtuous.</hi> Yes, yes, <hi>Daria</hi> (reply'd he) you are Virtuous! I can read in your Eyes no ſigns of laſt nights Revels! But come (continued he, and taking me by the hand) let's ſee the Scene where the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of my Houſe was acted. When he came to the Bed, Oh, Madam, I bluſh to tell, that the marks of Virgin Loves confeſs'd that weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which I ſtrove to hide. My Father was Thunder-ſtruck with what he ſaw, and running out of the Room, I could hear him at ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance cry, <hi>Oh my loſt</hi> Daria! I'm ſure, Madam, you will confeſs 'tis impoſſible to paint that grief I then felt; I fell into a ſwoon upon the Bed, and there lay ſome hours e're I recover'd my ſenſes. When my Judgment return'd, I felt a new return of all my pains too, I was ready to end all my griefs by one dire Blow, and I'm firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded, if any inſtrument of Death had been nigh, I had not now liv'd to mourn the loſs of <hi>Odmar.</hi> However amidſt all my ſorrows I remembred that Appointment he had made the ſucceeding night, and tho' I doubted much his Conſtancy, I reſolv'd to wait the event. Till <hi>that</hi> time ſhould come I knew not whither to betake my ſelf, I could not fly to a Friend's Houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then my ſhame would be notorious, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:179798:32"/> durſt not venture to ſhow my ſelf at home, when <hi>Ariſteon</hi> had ſworn he ne're would own me; e're I could come to a reſolution, my afflicted Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enter'd the Lodge. Well <hi>Daria,</hi> (ſaid ſhe) I come not to reproach you with a Crime that cannot now be mended, but to tell you that no Arguments can yet reconcile you to your Father. He denies your admittance to his Houſe. This indiſcreet way of Loving, has ſown that reproach upon our Family, (for can you think <hi>Odmar</hi> will wed a Fortune ſo mean as yours!) which no time ſhall be able to Root out. In a word, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſteon</hi> is mad with Grief, and you may gueſs at mine. However, come along with me, and ſtay in your Chamber without his knowledge, for my Tears may yet perſwade him to forgive this fault of Love and Youth. I was not able to give any anſwer to this tenderneſs of <hi>Julietta's,</hi> my grief was viſible in my Face, and ſufficiently pleaded my excuſe. I obey'd then, and when I was left alone in my Room, in a few minutes my condition was the ſame it had been a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Mother had come to me; and when the troubles of my mind again allow'd me the uſe of my ſenſes, I read my <hi>Odmar</hi>'s Letters a thouſand times, but found not half that pleaſure in 'em I had known before. At Night <hi>Julietta</hi> came again to ſee me, told me my Father's ſorrow was nothing yet abated, and that he was reſolv'd not loſe <hi>Dion</hi>'s Friendſhip, bid me make uſe of my Reaſon, and ſhun immoderate Grief, and ſo left me to my ſelf. I ſpent the Night without ſleep, and the next Morning yet encreas'd my fears, for now the hour approach'd, in which I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to ſee my <hi>Odmar,</hi> from whom alone I hop'd
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:179798:32"/> and wiſh'd relief. To be ſhort, Madam, Night at laſt arriv'd, but not my Lover. How I long'd and waited for him in that Lodge, where I had been once ſo happy, no Tongue can utter; I ſtaid there all Night, and, tho' in the dark and alone, void of my wonted fears, and only wept my own folly, and the young Man's unkind ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                     <p>In the Morning I found a Paper lying upon the Bed, I knew it to be <hi>Odmar</hi>'s, and wonder'd that my Father had not ſeen it the other Day. You muſt know, Madam, (for ſo I underſtood afterwards) 'twas written by a Friend of his, to whom I have ſince that time been much indebted. Having opened it with impatiency, I found theſe words.</p>

                     <p>You ſee by this broken line, Madam, the piece was not perfected, however, there was enough to move my grief and wonder; <hi>I</hi> was now fully perſwaded <hi>Odmar</hi> was unjuſt, and even when <hi>I</hi> believ'd him ſo, wonder'd that a Man, who look'd ſo like a god, could in his Nature be the worſt of Villains. <hi>I</hi> knew he was a Poet for his own pleaſure, and found by what <hi>I</hi> had read, he had ſpoke his Sentiments, not half his Art or Wit. <hi>I</hi> ſaw my Fortune painted in each line, and now (tho' ne're before) <hi>I</hi> wiſh'd <hi>I</hi> had not ſeen him. <hi>I</hi> found my ruine ineyitable, for ſince <hi>Odmar</hi> was unkind, <hi>I</hi> had no more to loſe. <hi>I</hi> had too convincing a proof of my ill Fortune, when <hi>I</hi> conſider'd he had written to me in the Morning, when he was to ſee me that Night, and could not reaſonably have expected a Letter from him; and that now when he had giv'n me
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:179798:33"/> the diſapointment, he had not been at the pains to excuſe himſelf, or ſay that yet he lov'd me.</p>
                     <p>This, Madam, is a tedious way of telling the ſtory of my Love. But <hi>I</hi> can do no leſs than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with my Griefs, becauſe the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of theſe things fill my Soul, and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a room to any other thought. To be ſhort then as poſſibly <hi>I</hi> can, <hi>I</hi> reſolv'd ſpeedily to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the World, and retire to a Nunnery a few Miles diſtant from <hi>Odmar</hi>'s Houſe. <hi>I</hi> had two young Couſins there, whom Love had made Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and <hi>I</hi> reſolv'd to ſpend my Days like them. <hi>I</hi> went privately to my Chamber, and took from thence every thing of Value and of little Bulk, read my Lover's kind Letters, and afterwards burnt them; with my Eyes took a long farewel of every thing in the Houſe, and, drown'd in Tears, <hi>I</hi> left it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> had not walk'd far, when my Grief and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble made me know, <hi>I</hi> was too weak for a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of five long Miles on Foot. Half faint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath a ſhady Tree <hi>I</hi> lay, and view'd the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Shepherds driving out their Flocks, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toning ev'n in Rags. <hi>I</hi> compar'd their happineſs with mine, and often wiſh'd <hi>I</hi> had been born like them, to moderate Wants, or to an humbler Fortune, bleſs'd with Peace and Innocence. <hi>I</hi> mourn'd all my Misfortunes at once, but moſt of all <hi>I</hi> griev'd the loſs of <hi>Odmar</hi>'s Letters; for <hi>I</hi> found even then when <hi>I</hi> ſuffer'd ſo much for him, 'twas not in my Power to hate him.</p>
                     <p>While thus <hi>I</hi> lay, <hi>I</hi> could ſee at ſome diſtance two Men on Horſe back; 'twas yet ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry early in the Morning, <hi>I</hi> could hardly think them leſs than Robbers. My fears ſuggeſted a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:179798:34"/> thouſand things to me, <hi>I</hi> remembred <hi>I</hi> was a Woman helpleſs and alone; and yet, Madam, by that great Power <hi>I</hi> ſwear that gave me firſt a Being, <hi>I</hi> wiſh'd them Murderers, Raviſhers, or any thing that was Cruel. Life was become a perfect burden to me, and <hi>I</hi> was reſolv'd ſome way or other to be reliev'd from the weight. As they approach'd, <hi>I</hi> ſtep'd into the Road, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, as if <hi>I</hi> had done it by Chance, any thing of value about me to tempt the vicious Wretches, then by reſiſtance prompt them on to fury. This conduct <hi>I</hi> confeſs was a greater Crime than any <hi>I</hi> had yet committed, but your Grace will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that <hi>Deſpair</hi> has no acquaintance with <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> did it with a ſetled deſign to advance my ruin. When they came cloſe up to me, Oh Heavens! what art can expreſs my ſurpriſe, for <hi>I</hi> had almoſt fainted with exceſs of Joy! In the depth of my miſery, and ſunk beneath my ſelf, my kind, juſt <hi>Odmar</hi> came to raiſe me up. Oh <hi>Daria!</hi> (cry'd he, alighting from his Horſe) Whither art thou going? Why do <hi>I</hi> read in thy Face ſo many ſigns of paſt grief? Did you ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect me? Oh! by Heavens! I'm mad with Joy! For whate're has brought thy Tears, <hi>I</hi> find thy Sorrows to thy Beauties add. When <hi>I</hi> could ſpeak, Oh <hi>Odmar!</hi> (ſaid I) do I owe this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to Chance or You? No, (reply'd he ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly) to your ſelf only, if you had been leſs Fair, or leſs Kind, I had been leſs Conſtant; and now I know you Love me, we ſhall both be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. But I have nothing, my Dear, (continued he) to repay that Joy you give me, a heart ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, which Heaven deſign'd but for it ſelf and you; for I have acquainted <hi>Dion</hi> with my
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:179798:34"/> Love, but he (tho' otherwiſe kind) is inexorable, and ſwears if I perſiſt he ne're ſhall ſee me more. The hopes nevertheleſs of obtaining his conſent kept me from my <hi>Daria</hi> yeſterday, but could not do ſo to day. Ah! <hi>Odmar,</hi> (cry'd I) <hi>The gods were paſſive,</hi> and you might have come. But I am ruin'd, my Father has baniſh'd me from his Houſe, and our ſtoln happineſs is—No, (ſaid he, interrupting me, and with all the tenderneſs ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable) if my Love can repay the loſs of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſteon</hi>'s ſmiles, my <hi>Daria</hi> is not ruin'd. <hi>Here</hi> (continued he, and turning to his Friend) <hi>this is my Wife;</hi> You can confirm our Vows already made, and as you tender my Life obey. To be brief, Madam, <hi>Odmar</hi> was ſingular in his Love and Virtues. We were that day marry'd, (for his Friend was a Prieſt, whom the kind Youth had brought on purpoſe) bleſs'd with ſafe poſſeſſion, and both Exiles, cauſe we lov'd too well.</p>
                     <p>We retir'd to a Gentleman's Houſe, who was <hi>Odmar</hi>'s Relation and mine too. He writ often to his Father, but the old Man was deaf to all entreaties. Mine would not loſe <hi>Dion</hi>'s Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, tho' he pardon'd me in his Heart; and my Mother alone was kind to us both, and ſent me frequent Letters in return of mine. We went ſeldom abroad, we were welcome to our kind Friend, we lov'd more paſſionately than ever, and ſcarce one Night paſt without a recital of our firſt night's Joys, our mutual Fears that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, his longings, my Pains, and thoſe thoughts we entertain'd for one another, when firſt old <hi>Dion</hi> languiſh'd in our Houſe. Thus, Madam, we liv'd two Years, and I can confidently affirm, that to the laſt hour we had thoſe little Cares to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:179798:35"/> pleaſe, true Love, and conſtant fondneſs for each other, we knew that Night I yielded in the Lodge. At laſt this happy Scene vaniſh'd, and tho' the ſtory grates my Soul, and awakes my ſlumbering Griefs, yet, Madam, for your ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction take it thus.</p>
                     <p>Our King (the good <hi>Othredus)</hi> unfortunate in his Councils, tho' of himſelf Juſt and Merciful even to a fault, was at laſt by Knaves betray'd, and by his Friends abandon'd. In this extremity he fled, and (ſeeking protection from his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Monarch) left the Government to the management of others. <hi>Scarronida</hi> was ſo fond of their new Government, that he was judg'd a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to his Country, who enterrain'd but favourable thoughts for his native injur'd Lord. The Eaſtern part of the Nation, nevertheleſs betook themſelves to Arms, and tho' they were but a handful of Men, (the number of their Enemies conſider'd) boldly kept the Field, and bid Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the new crown'd Head. <hi>Dion</hi> was one in this Loyal Army, and finding he was incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of enduring thoſe fatigues inherent to his Poſt, he ſent at laſt for <hi>Odmar.</hi> My Father fought as he did, and whether or not he perſwaded the old Man to reaſſume his good Nature upon this occaſion, I cannot poſitively affirm. My kind Husband ſhow'd me the Letter he had receiv'd, and ask'd my advice concerning that Anſwer he deſign'd, when at the ſame time he knew I had that reſpect for his Judgment, which fond little Children bear to that of a tender Mother. In a word, tho' the old Man had freely pardon'd him, yet he would not obey, till firſt he had ſecur'd his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:179798:35"/> 
                        <hi>Daria,</hi> and therefore let him know, that tho' he was kind, yet his Son was ſtill unfortunate, unleſs he were doubly ſo to me; and, as a mark of his unfeign'd Reconciliation, ſettl'd one half of his Eſtate upon me, if 'twere my Fortune to ſurvive ſo good a Husband. <hi>Dion</hi> readily agreed to this, and aſſur'd him he deſerv'd more than he had to beſtow upon him, ſince his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy to me ſufficiently excus'd his primitive diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience upon the ſcore of Love. I firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our hoſpitable Friend <hi>Tameran,</hi> (for that was his Name) alone griev'd our better Fortune. He was an old Batchelor and an hater of Women, and the Author of thoſe lines which <hi>Odmar</hi> had Copied, and by chance drop'd in the Lodge, yet he confeſs'd that in ſpite of his humour he found a certain pleaſure, when he ſaw our mutual fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and happy way of living, and often ſwore if he could find a Woman like me, and himſelf could Love like <hi>Odmar,</hi> he'd be no more an Enemy to Marriage. When we came to <hi>Dion</hi>'s Houſe, we were receiv'd with all that reſpect and aſſurances of his affection we could deſire, and <hi>Ariſteon</hi> wept for Joy to ſee his Daughter bleſs'd</p>
                     <p>'Twas ne're my chance to be every way Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and <hi>Odmar</hi>'s abſence leſſen'd or quite remov'd the ſenſe of my preſent Fortune. The Loyal Army lay but a few Miles from <hi>Dion</hi>'s Houſe, ſo that I heard from him every Day, and by the gods I ſwear, Madam, I read the Letters with the ſame Joy, I knew when faithful <hi>Riga</hi> gave me that one I mention'd under a pretence of ſeeking Papers which he ne're had loſt. Heaven ne're ſaw two ſuch Lovers, and when the new
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:179798:36"/> King's Army came into the boſom of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I felt a thouſand deadly Fears for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſharer of my Joys.</p>
                     <p>In a few Days they came to a pitch'd Battle, where the General of the old King's Forces loſt his Life, tho' he gain'd the Victory. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd, and Death o'recame the Conquerour: <hi>Odmar</hi> flew to my Arms, the danger once I fear'd was now paſt, and ſecurity made us doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſs'd. He ſtay'd a Month, which as an hour appear'd, and the new King having muſter'd new Troops, he left me to ſeek new Hazards: The Armies again met, but Fortune had fled with the General, and we (if I may properly ſay I was on <hi>Odmar</hi>'s ſide) loſt the Day, and all that Honour we had gain'd before. My Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band however was ſafe, and I askt no more; our remaining Troops were by degrees cut off, and in a ſhort time no Man appear'd in Arms but <hi>Dion</hi> and his Followers. Unable to keep the Field he retir'd to a little Town, which yet own'd no power ſuperior to his own. This he forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſtor'd with Proviſions, ſuch as the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs'd Country could afford. In the mean time the ſucceſsful Monarch, wearied with the Civil War, and willing to ſecure with ſeeming mercy what with Blood he had purchas'd, offer'd to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man that would lay down his Arms the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of a Kariph, with you call an Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity. <hi>Dion,</hi> who wiſely ſaw he could be no longer ſerviceable to his Prince by an obſtinate reſiſtance, laid hold of this opportunity, and made his Peace with Honour. In ſhort, our Gates were open'd, we rely'd upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour's Promiſe, admitted his Troops, and made
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:179798:36"/>
'em boſom Friends. Now it was, I thought my ſelf beyond the reach of Fortune's frowns, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt elevated above the power of Fate. <hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Ariſteon</hi> found themſelves bleſs'd beyond what e're they hop'd, and never ſaw us without Joy and Wonder. Oh Heav'ns! how innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we liv'd, and lov'd as when firſt we ſwore we did ſo. Poor <hi>Odmar</hi> thought of nothing but his <hi>Daria,</hi> and I never dreamt of any thing but him. We deſcry'd new Beauties in one another every Day, long'd and wiſh'd like Bride and Bridgroom, gaz'd, embrac'd, and knew no pains, but when in each others Arms we ſigh'd and fear'd we had not lov'd alike.—Now, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, pardon my Tears, for when I have told you all, you'll own my griefs are juſt.</p>
                     <p>One Night as awake I lay, I heard my <hi>Od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> groaning in his Sleep. 'Twas the firſt time he ever had done ſo, and I was much amaz'd; but more, when ſuddenly raiſing himſelf up, he cry'd, <hi>Oh ſpare my</hi> Daria<hi>'s, and I'll give you mine.</hi> Ha my Dear! (cry'd I) Whither does your fancy wander? Why thus afear'd when there's no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger nigh. The kind Youth rouz'd from his Sleep, caught me in his Arms, kiſs'd me with tranſport, ſigh'd, and would have ſlept again, had not I preſs'd his hand in mine, and conjur'd him to tell me why he had pronounc'd my Name. Ah! <hi>Daria,</hi> (ſaid he) I can yet hardly think I have thee in my Arms, ſo much I fear'd thee loſt. I dreamt (and oh methinks 'twas a very lively dream) that <hi>Tameran</hi> our kind Friend, who entertain'd us when unfortunate, pull'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Curtain, and with looks that ſpoke him fill'd with dire revenge, threatned thy life and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:179798:37"/> mine, for Crimes he fear'd that I had done, but meant not to reveal. You take me for a Friend, (ſaid he) but you ſhall find a Foe, where leaſt you dreamt of one; I truſt not the Man who once offends, for tho' he begs my pardon afterwards, yet I conſider that as the effect of my power and his neceſſity, not Love or real Friendſhip. This ſaid, methought he ſtruck his Dagger to my Heart, and ſwore you too ſhould bleed. 'Twas that my Dear, (continued he) which broke the Chain of Sleep, and ſet my Tongue at liberty. When <hi>Odmar</hi> ſpoke, I felt the ſame pain as if it had not been a dream; but that which ſunk me moſt, was that this ſame Night I had ſeen old <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> expiring on his Bed, and ghaſtly in his Wounds. To encreaſe my fears, my Windows ſtood all open, and between me and the Skies I ſaw the Heads and Limbs of murder'd Friends, heard the ſhrieks of tortur'd Souls that wander'd in the Air, and howling Ghoſts to ſnowy ſhrowds confin'd. I ſhrunk, and graſpt my <hi>Odmar</hi> in my Arms, and e're I ſpoke I'd view the Scene again; but as I was about to tell my fears to my Dear kind Youth, I heard a dreadful noiſe upon the Stairs. The Chamber-door was immediately forc'd open, and Ruffians mask'd in Armour ſtraight ruſh'd in: My fears would not let me cry. But the more daring <hi>Odmar</hi> leapt from the Bed, and with his Sword receiv'd them. Oh Heavens! this god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Man did all a mortal could, but cover'd o're with Wounds at laſt he fell. <hi>Oh baſe Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains! Oh</hi> Daria! Daria! he cry'd, and in that moment dy'd. The ſenſeleſs Clay their utmoſt ſury felt, and they ſtab'd <hi>Odmar,</hi> after <hi>Odmar</hi> fled. I ſaw't, Madam, (and oh that I liv'd to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:179798:37"/> ſee ſo much) yet found that 'twas not in my power to ſpeak, for my Soul (affrighted with the horrid ſight) retir'd and left me deſtitute of ſenſe. This alone ſav'd my Life, for the cruel murderers when they ſaw me motionleſs on the Floor, and drench'd in my Husband's Blood, believ'd me dead, e're they forſook the Room. When I recover'd my Soul half fled, I knew not what to think, I was in a perfect frenzy, and would have thought all a Dream ſtill, if I had not found the wounded Body by me, nay even then I ſcarce could think my ſelf awake; for when I examin'd my life paſt, in all my ſearch I ſaw not one maſſy Sin that could have pull'd this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el ſtroak from Heaven, nor could I think that the juſt gods had us'd me ſo, when I had ſtudied never to offend. The bloody Executioners had carry'd their dark Lanthorns with them, and I, to be convinc'd of my own unhappineſs, (undreſt as I was) run into the other Room to tell old <hi>Dion</hi> that his Son was loſt, and <hi>Daria</hi> juſt grown Mad; for, Madam, I muſt confeſs I really was ſo. Oh! what words or art can paint my pains, and the horrours of that Night! The Father was murder'd e're the Son was cold, and <hi>Ariſteon</hi> ſhar'd in <hi>Odmar</hi>'s fate, he and my Mother were both butcher'd; and (if ſo Heav'n had pleas'd) would <hi>Daria</hi> too had dy'd, for not one of <hi>Dion</hi>'s Relations eſcap'd but my ſelf. You may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Madam, that e're a Man was found to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute ſo barbarous a Commiſſion, for you muſt know (tho' 'tis very ſtrange) the new Stateſmen fearing, that (if the exil'd Prince ſhould at any time attempt the recovery of his own) <hi>Dion</hi> would prove a dangerous Subject, they thought it
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:179798:38"/> ſitting by this cruel method to prevent that ill they fear'd. My juſt griefs robb'd me of the uſe of my Reaſon, and 'twas my Fortune not to feel the weight of my own unhappy Fate, (for oh, Madam, I had loſt the beſt of Men) but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of my ſhort intervals. A neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring old Gentlewoman of <hi>Julietta</hi>'s acquaintance took a particular care of me, and after fifteen long Months I was again my ſelf. But tho' bleſs'd with my Reaſon, I was ſtill oppreſs'd with Grief, and therefore without acquainting any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, (nay my benefactor her ſelf was kept a ſtranger to it) I quit the Scene where all my ills were acted, and came in Tears to <hi>Armenis.</hi> My Fortune preferr'd me to your Graces eſteem, to whom I confeſs I am more indebted than all my coming ſervices can e're repay. I've told you a ſtory I have long conceal'd, and, Madam, you may believe the Widdow of <hi>Odmar</hi> would not ſo far betray her Honour, as to conceal any part of the truth, or add any thing that was not ſo.</p>
                     <p>Here, my <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> the lovely unfortunate <hi>Daria</hi> ended her Story, and the tender hearted Dutcheſs wept for <hi>Odmar</hi>'s death, begg'd her pardon if ſhe had not us'd her conform to her Quality and Merit, and aſſur'd her, that for the future ſhe would make it her Study to teach her to forget her Misfortunes. <hi>Eriphile</hi> was always good, and ſhe was at this time ſo much concern'd for the death of ſo kind a Man, that ſhe told <hi>Daria</hi> ſhe could dwell eternally upon the Story, and there ſettle her thoughts, if the ſad remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and frequent repetition did not renew the Tears of one who had ſo juſt cauſe to Mourn:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:179798:38"/> As ſhe ſpoke <hi>Erinthus</hi> enter'd. The Dutcheſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the fortunate Youth with all the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a conquer'd Beauty, told him the Duke was gone to Court, and kind Love had allotted the few minutes of his abſence for the happineſs of both. Poor <hi>Daria</hi> bluſh'd and withdrew, and the Lovers, now left to themſelves, let looſe their wiſhes, and ſurfeited in pleaſure. But as they lay in each others Arms, their Souls upon the Wing, and fear'd, by coveting too faſt, deſire ſhould be loſt, the injur'd Duke arriv'd; pardon me, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſinda,</hi> if I omit not the particulars of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture. Their mutual Joys had baniſh'd uſual Fears, and he knock'd at the Chamber-door e're they had thought him nigh. <hi>Erinthus</hi> nimbly ſtarted from the Bed, and ſenſible of his own danger, and the Crime he had committed, half dreſt, leapt from the Chamber-Window into the Garden, and with the hazard of his Neck made his eſcape. <hi>Entheon</hi> ſaw him, and, in a height of ſudden paſſion, fir'd a Piſtol after him, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the wiſh'd ſucceſs. 'Tis eaſie to gueſs in what a poſture he found the lovely Dutcheſs, half dead with fear, and unable to hide, what even to <hi>Enthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſhe ſhould have ne're expos'd tho' in her ſtate of Innocence: Beſides, to evince her guilt, and that ſhe had been actually happy in anothers Arms, the lucky Youth when from the Bed he leapt, had left the uſual Marks of Love behind him. This indeed, the Duke had not the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to ſee, for one of the Maids, who was privy to the Amour, enter'd the Chamber with him, and hid the baſe remains of interrupted Love.</p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:179798:39"/>
                     <p> 
                        <hi>Eriphile</hi> at once bluſh'd and wept, ſhe ſaw 'twas impoſſible to deny what had paſt between her and <hi>Erinthus,</hi> and did not ſo much as offer to extenuate the Crime. <hi>Entheon</hi> knew his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour betray'd, his conſtant Love repay'd with Treachery, and griev'd that e're he went to <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſala</hi>'s Houſe. Then again remembring her Bluſhes, when firſt he ſaw her in the Garden, her Love which at that time was real, and all thoſe tender words ſhe utter'd in his Arms, ſince ſhe became a Wife, he grew almoſt mad, and the thoughts of loſing ſo much ſweetneſs rack'd his very Soul: Again he ey'd the weeping Fair, and again ſtorm'd and griev'd. He curſt the hour brought <hi>Erinthus</hi> to his Houſe, and ſaw that if he reveng'd this great affront, he could gain no honour by it, the Quality of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſider'd. Beſides <hi>Eriphile</hi> was always dear to him, and now (tho' falſe to the laſt degree) as lovely as ever ſhe had been. The powerful Charms of a weeping Beauty can ne're be truly painted. To have ſeen the Dutcheſs at this time was to be eternally hers, and when ſhe look'd upon her injur'd Lord, ſhe ſhow'd a certain ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of force enough to enſlave at once the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Soul. You may believe then, <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinda,</hi> the generous <hi>Entheon</hi> was not inſenſible when he beheld her. He ſate ſometime ſpeechleſs, and thinking on his loſs, then ſuddenly ſtarting up, he threw himſelf upon the Bed, took her in his Arms, and kiſs'd away her fears. Ah, <hi>Eriphile!</hi> (cry'd he) how I lov'd you, Heaven and you can tell! How my conſtancy has been rewarded, I'm aſham'd to ſpeak! But oh! why <hi>Erinthus</hi> is preferr'd to <hi>Entheon,</hi> you alone can ſay! Was
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:179798:39"/> your Honour (now inſeparably ty'd to mine) a Triffle, and Marriage Vows a whim of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood? No, no, <hi>Eriphile,</hi> the World will take notice of the firſt, and Heaven I fear can ſcarce neglect the latter. But I, by all that's good, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give you. Let not my diſgrace and your weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be the Table diſcourſe of a whole Nation: Let all that's paſt be huſh'd up in eternal Silence, and for the future to <hi>Entheon</hi> and to your ſelf be juſt. Sure, <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> you'll confeſs 'twas a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sin to offend ſo good a Husband. The ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Eriphile</hi> for that time was truly ſenſible of this, and, drown'd in Tears, (tho' yet in Bed) threw her ſelf upon her Knees, graſpt <hi>Entheon</hi>'s Hand, and, weeping, ſwore by all the Powers above, and by that juſt Heaven ſhe had too much offended, ſhe griev'd what ſhe had done, and for the future would prove her ſelf the moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient humble Wife that ever yet was known; adding, his exceſs of Goodneſs and Generoſity encreas'd the weight of her <hi>Guilt;</hi> ſhe ſaw with ſorrow, how far ſhe had err'd, and aſſur'd him that no temptation ſhould e're again perſwade her to forget how much ſhe ow'd to <hi>Entheon</hi> or her ſelf. The kind Duke forgave her all, rais'd her up, took her again to his Arms, and told her he griev'd nothing more, than that <hi>Erinthus,</hi> proud of ſo great a Conqueſt, might betray the Secret; to prevent which, 'twas fitting he ſhould bleed, for the ſecurity of hers and his own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The lovely <hi>Eriphile,</hi> tho' ſhe truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented the wrong ſhe had done her Husband, yet found too ſoon ſhe had not wholly baniſh'd her Lover from her Breaſt. She ey'd the Duke with concern, and reading in his Face the ſigns of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:179798:40"/> cloſe revenge, ſhe fell a ſecond time upon her Knees, conjur'd him to believe that ſhe was hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſenſible of that fault ſhe had committed, but could not think the death of <hi>Erinthus,</hi> the moſt proper method to ſecure his Honour; begg'd as he tender'd her Life, he'd lay aſide that thought, and, as he had already promis'd, pardon all that was done. The Duke could deny her nothing; and ſure, <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> his eaſineſs that way was very pardonable; for had ſhe ſtood before that ſurly old <hi>Cynicks Diogenes,</hi> he'd not have us'd her with that freedom he expreſs'd to the World's great Conquerour, he'd willingly have quit his Book, and gaz'd upon her, or at leaſt have ſought no other light but what her eyes could give. Oh, <hi>Albiſinda!</hi> ſome People may blame him for an exceſs of good Nature, upon this and other Emergencies that concern'd <hi>Eriphile.</hi> But then, believe me, their Hearts are of a different Mould from that of this Noble Man, and they ne're ſaw <hi>Eriphile,</hi> or were capable of any tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that think they could have reſented the ill ſhe had done; eſpecially when ſhe kneel'd and begg'd forgiveneſs. In a word, my <hi>Albiſinda, Entheon</hi> granted every thing, ſhe promis'd any thing, he believ'd all, ſhe ſeem'd ſenſible of all, and both were happy in a new Agreement.</p>
                     <p>I'm afraid <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> (for I frankly confeſs my want of Art or Power to move the Paſſions) that by this time you wiſh my Letter finiſh'd. But the ſtory affords no great number of Adventures, and that of <hi>Daria,</hi> having waſted more than half my time, you will find me generous in ſpite of my ſelf, becauſe neceſſarily oblig'd to relieve you from the trouble. I ſhall then, Madam, (like
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:179798:40"/> our famous Teachers) only beg one minutes pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and venture to take two.</p>
                     <p>The Duke tho' he had lov'd much, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd much, yet could not chuſe but fear more. He remembred that <hi>Eriphile</hi> was a <hi>Woman,</hi> that <hi>Erinthus</hi> was young and handſom, that he was new, and already in poſſeſſion of her Favours. Theſe conſiderations taught him to obſerve her Conduct narrowly, he conſulted her very looks, and tho' his Judgment always maſter'd his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, yet ſometimes he could not chuſe but think, he read his own diſhonour painted in her Eyes. On the other hand the Dutcheſs fear'd to offend, becauſe ſhe could not reaſonably expect to find him always merciful. <hi>Erinthus</hi> griev'd the loſs of his happineſs, but more <hi>Eriphile's</hi> cares, and knew not that the Duke had ſign'd her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and ſeal'd it with his Love. Unwilling ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs to loſe that happineſs he had enjoy'd, by the help of <hi>powerful Guinea,</hi> he convey'd the following <hi>Billet-deux</hi> to the longing Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs.</p>

                     <p>The happy young Man receiv'd it, and fail'd not to obey. When the hour came, he appear'd upon the place with all the longings of a Lover; as yet he ſaw not one Woman there, and was almoſt aſſur'd of a diſappointment, when a lovely Youth approach'd his Chariot. <hi>Erinthus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd him ſent from the Dutcheſs, and bid the Coach-man ſtop, and you may think him hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſurpris'd, when he found the handſom Youth was no other than the Dutcheſs of <hi>Entheon.</hi> The Duke ſhortly after, by chance, drove the ſame way, and as he paſt, <hi>Eriphile</hi> gave him a low Bow, as other ſtrangers did. You may aſſure your ſelf, they ſtay'd not long in the Walk, there were greater ſweets to be found in a Bed-Chamber than in the open Fields, and they forgot all thoſe hazards they had lately paſt. At ten they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Dutcheſs got home with all that eaſe and ſecurity ſhe deſir'd. Her two faithful Maids ſtood at the Gate to receive her, and as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:179798:41"/> ſhe enter'd inform'd her that <hi>Entheon</hi> was at home, that he had enquir'd after her, but that they had told him ſhe was indiſpos'd, and begg'd his Grace's pardon. Had Fortune continued this kindneſs, all had been well; but, <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> you'll confeſs 'twas hard, that e're ſhe had fairly enter'd the Room, and ready to undreſs, the impatient Duke knock'd at the Door. <hi>Eriphile</hi> (with a Voice ſeemingly faint) askt who it was, and knowing too ſoon that 'twas the Duke, you may eaſily think ſhe was ſtartl'd with the ſudden ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of her danger. But not ſo confus'd as to neglect her own ſafety, ſhe told his Grace, ſhe was ſo very ill, ſhe could not yet come to the Door without difficulty. <hi>Entheon,</hi> who lov'd her to diſtraction, fear'd that her indiſpoſition might indeed be dangerous, and, unable to live one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute from her ſight, gently forc'd it open, and found her in the ſame dreſs in which ſhe had bleſs'd her Lover; her Wig and Sword lay ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious on the Table, and not one ſign of indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition appear'd. The great <hi>Entheon</hi> became dumb with ſorrow, and the charming <hi>Eriphile</hi> knew not what to ſay for her ſelf. At laſt, the Duke broke ſilence, and calmly, but with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, told her, That if ſhe was not really ſick, ſhe ought to have been ſo, ſeeing his Honour had again been ſtab'd, and hers was truly dead. This generous Man, <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> ſaid no more; he lov'd her even yet, and griev'd her weakneſs. He ey'd her a while, and in ſpite of all his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his Heart melted. But willing to hide his ſoftneſs, he feign'd another Paſſion, ſhow'd an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in his looks, and yet in Tears withdrew. When he was gone, <hi>Eriphile</hi> threw her ſelf upon
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:179798:42"/> the Bed, wept her own Misfortune, and wiſh'd ſhe could yet be ſenſible of <hi>Entheon</hi>'s merit; and when with pain ſhe view'd him noble, as when firſt he ſaw her, <hi>Erinthus</hi> leapt between her and the lovely form, and ſhe could think of nothing elſe but him. In the mean time the Duke ſent for the Earl of <hi>Ciſala,</hi> and acquainted him with all that paſt ſince that Night ſhe and <hi>Fidelia</hi> went to the Play-houſe. The old Man was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſurpris'd with what he heard, and thankt him for that moderation he had ſhown, in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair where ſo many provoking cauſes were given, and told him, that <hi>Eriphile</hi>'s Education had ne're taught her to diſhonour his Houſe, and again bleſs'd him for not expoſing to the World the diſgrace of his ſeduc'd Daughter. <hi>Eriphile</hi> yet lay upon the Bed, and was perfectly mad with grief, when ſhe ſaw her Husband and her Father enter. She was too in that dreſs which betray'd the Secret; and, weeping as ſhe roſe to receive them. Ah my Lord, (ſaid ſhe to <hi>Ciſala) I</hi> own my guilt, load me not with reproaches, but rob me of my Life, for I deſerve not to live; ſince I've diſhonour'd you, and wrong'd ſo good a Husband, Oh <hi>Entheon!</hi> (continued ſhe) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ask forgivneſs, you have been too kind, and I too ingrateful, yet e're I dye let me receive your Pardon. Whether ſhe truly repented or not, <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> is not to be doubted; for ſhe ne're ſaw <hi>Entheon,</hi> but ſhe lov'd him. But when he and <hi>Erinthus</hi> were both abſent, her Heart inclin'd to the latter, and own'd him much the happier Man. But, Madam, why ſhould I detain you longer upon this Adventure, ſince I've already promis'd a ſpeedy Concluſion. In a word then,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:179798:42"/> the Duke lov'd too well, and ſhe was too charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Her new dreſs gave her a thouſand Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, expos'd the tenderneſs and delicacy of her ſhape, and ſhow'd ſo much of ſoftneſs in her Air, 'twas enough to have charm'd the moſt inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Human Kind, for even when in the Grove ſhe lay, and ſhow'd by chance what elſe had been conceal'd, her Limbs appear'd not to the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd Youth, with half thoſe Beauties which he now diſcover'd. <hi>Ciſala</hi> too interceded for her, and 'twas morally impoſſible for the Duke not to be reconcil'd to ſo fair an offender.</p>
                     <p>Things being thus ſetled, they liv'd for ſome time in a ſeeming Union. How far their Hearts were engag'd in this peace I ſhall not offer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, but by what has follow'd it appears, the Dutcheſs kept not to Articles on her ſide. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus</hi> it ſeems had too many Charms to be with eaſe forgot, and even in <hi>Entheon</hi>'s Arms ſhe ſigh'd and wiſh'd for him. The Duke ſome Months after was oblig'd to go into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where he ſtay'd a conſiderable time. He truſted much to <hi>Eriphile</hi>'s Promiſes, and (confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of her future conduct) left her with that eaſe and peace of mind, which happy Husbands know, of virtuous Wives poſſeſs'd. In his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence 'twas impoſſible for <hi>Eriphile</hi> to be conſtant to her Vows, <hi>Erinthus</hi> attacqu'd her with Letters, and all the Arts of a cunning Lover, knowing that where a Woman once has yielded, 'tis rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found ſhe can deny again. In a word, the Lover was again happy, and the witty fair <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phile</hi> again was faulty. The continued abſence of <hi>Entheon</hi> gave them all that ſecurity they could deſire, and frequent meetings made the Crime at
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:179798:43"/> laſt ſo obvious, that all the World took notice on't. Every Servant in the Houſe knew it, and tho' they lov'd the Dutcheſs, yet hated the happy Lover. He often ſtay'd all Night; and 'tis known that two of the Maids at a certain time peeping throw the Key-hole ſaw them in Bed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Curtain at foot being open, and next morning could perceive the marks of impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Love, and ſigns of Honour loſt. Nay the Intrigue grew ſo notorious, that <hi>Erinthus</hi>'s Friends enquir'd for him no where but at the Duke of <hi>Entheon</hi>'s; and <hi>Fidelia,</hi> one day before many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, by way of raillery, askt <hi>Eriphile,</hi> if <hi>Erin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> was not in her Cloſet? We ſhall ſee him (ſaid ſhe laughing) appear by and by like a fatigu'd Traveller. There was one thing too, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently demonſtrated that familiarity between the Fair One and this fortunate Youth. One of her Maids coming accidentally into the Room, found the charming Dutcheſs in a Poſture that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly betray'd paſt or intended Crimes; for ſhe was ſitting upon the Bed, where the happy Lover was allow'd thoſe freedoms which fire the weary Soul, and give new flames, that when encreas'd expire. 'Tis impoſſible to find me an Anchorite ſo frozen or devout, that could have ſeen the half of all thoſe Charms, without a paſſion not to be expreſt; his Hands graſpther naked Limbs, ſhe wanton'd, wiſh'd and ſigh'd, and ſhow'd ſo much of pleaſure in her Eyes, his very Soul grew giddy with the Joy. The Dutcheſs (and not without juſt cauſe) was heartily diſpleas'd with that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very the Maid had made, and in a paſſion, to which ſhe was much a ſtranger, deſir'd <hi>Erinthus</hi> would for this impudence kick her down Stairs; but
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:179798:43"/>
'tis to be preſum'd ſhe ſay'd him that labour by her ſpeedy abſence.</p>
                     <p>At laſt the unwelcome Duke came from the Country, and having thoſe in the Family who watch'd the behaviour of his Wife, he was ſoon inform'd how faulty ſhe had been. However he conceal'd his reſentment as much as poſſible, took her as kindly to his Arms as ever, and only waited for an ocular proof of her infidelity, e're he ſhould attempt to right himſelf. <hi>Eriphile</hi> believ'd him ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of all, and without a bluſh receiv'd him. This added to his inward Fury, and <hi>I</hi> may almoſt believe, (ſo much he hated diſſimulation and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery) that had ſhe again confeſs'd the truth, and again begg'd pardon, he had lóv'd again. But Fortune was never her Friend, and ſhe never yet was guilty of any thing, but what was by ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ing from the Ground! The ſurpris'd Youth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to run the hazard of the Duke's Fury, whom he had too viſibly injur'd, abandon'd the place, and between running and walking ſoon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:179798:44"/> from his ſight. The wiſe Husband was pleas'd he fled, knowing 'twas beneath himſelf to reſent the Villany. He weighed his Birth and <hi>Eriphile</hi>'s repeated guilt, and now reſolv'd upon a way of revenge proper to her Crimes, he ſtept again into his Chariot, and without ſpeaking one word to the mortified Dutcheſs, order'd the Coach-man to drive immediately home. Poor <hi>Eriphile</hi> was almoſt mad with grief, ſhe could not expect kinder uſage from the Duke, nor could ſhe blame <hi>Erinthus</hi> for what he did; tho' if ſhe had not lov'd too much, ſhe had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got that he went off and left her in the hands of an incens'd Husband. In the mean time the Coach was again fitted up, and ſhe came to <hi>Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> with more ſorrow than e're ſhe had known before; ſhe durſt not truſt her ſelf with the Duke after what had paſt, nor could ſhe think of being truly welcome to her Father. To relieve her from theſe anxieties, as ſhe enter'd the Port, <hi>Erinthus</hi> (who had waited with impatiency) ſhow'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſhe was glad to ſee him, and the Coach door boing opened, ſhe received him with all that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of which a Woman is capable. To be ſhort, <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> they went off together, and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riphile</hi> now ſecure in her Lover's Houſe, forgot her fears, her Honour and her Husband. She remembred not now how much ſhe was eſteemed when Virtuous, and ſcarce could think her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Vows a Crime. <hi>Entheon</hi> in the mean time ſought to redreſs his Honour, and before the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala</hi> (with us called a Spiritual Court) ſued for a Divorce. The Dutcheſs, tho' unfortunate in her amour, had nevertheleſs managed it ſo well, that he found it impoſſible to caſt her; and tho' 'twas
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:179798:44"/> known that ſhe was guilty of the Crime laid to her Charge, yet it could not at that time be proved; and ſhe enjoy'd her Lover and her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. The Duke's and her diſhonour was now the publick Theme of every diſcourſe in <hi>Cluſa,</hi> all Men were ſorry for her, and no Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd his diſcreet Conduct. But, <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> her confidence of her own ſafety advanc'd her Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. <hi>Entheon</hi> was too great a Man to be always abus'd, and having at laſt remov'd his Suit, the powerful <hi>Segdarin</hi> (or Senate) did him Juſtice, and ſhe is at this time the Divorc'd <hi>Eriphile,</hi> once the happy Dutcheſs of <hi>Entheon.</hi> Some People may alledge, that the Duke was too formal in his Reſentment, and that he ought to have puniſh'd <hi>Erinthus</hi> as the Crime deſerv'd; that is to ſay, <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> ſhot him when he found him in his way to <hi>Cluſa,</hi> or at leaſt after his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment in the firſt Tryal. But 'tis certain <hi>Entheon</hi> choſe the better way; 'twas known to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man that he wanted not Courage, and in in his Youth he has even run beyond Seas, on purpoſe nobly to reſent affronts to others done, who were not truly capable of doing Juſtice to themſelves or him, whoſe Honour ſuffer'd in their Perſons.</p>
                     <p>You ſee, <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> (becauſe I would not rob you of all patience) l've come to a concluſion ſo ſpeedily, that I have almoſt cramp'd the Story: But you are the Woman whom by no means I would offend, and tho' I writ with pleaſure, yet I deny my ſelf a continuation of that happineſs, rather than be too troubleſome. Oh, <hi>Albiſinda!</hi> if you knew my thoughts or inclinations, you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

But if I have offended you, I buy their Friendſhip at a price too dear. How cruel you have been, Madam, I ceaſe to mention now, but I preſume this way of writing was not prohibited that fatal Night in which you told me I was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to expect your Friendſhip, and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of being the firſt Man in your Eſteem, but could not hope for Love. <hi>Albiſinda,</hi> I could trace the Story even to that place where firſt we met, and where two Fools (who alone it ſeems are fortunate) were happy, and had that Heaven they ſought, by jugling Quacks allow'd. I could ſhow my innocence, or at leaſt excuſe whate're I did by putting you in mind of my Years. But, by my hopes of better Fortune, I know not yet what 'twas that mov'd your anger, and I rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your goodneſs only for a pardon: I could for ever think on the innocent Pleaſures of that day in which you mention'd the Story in <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> your obliging Compliment, and that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of my flame which immediatly follow'd the Encouragement—The remembrance of theſe things make me truly Melancholy, and I am forc'd to end. Oh, <hi>Albiſinda!</hi> I'll ſay no more then; but, if you can, remember the Man who has often ſubſcrib'd himſelf,</p>

                  <p>THE few Accidents afforded in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of my Life, (or rather my Love) are ſuch as modeſty ſometimes forbids me the recital; and aſſure your ſelf, that were it not I had a more than common eſteem of her who lays this Command upon me, I ſhould no doubt conceal a great part of what I deſign to write. But the promiſe you have made me of a return in the ſame kind prevails moſt upon me; this I am eaſily induc'd to confeſs, becauſe you know me naturally curious in Affairs of Love, and I'm perſwaded the number of your Adorers has render'd you the Miſtreſs of a great many Adventures. I am not accuſtomed to write Letters of this length, and therefore I cannot hope to avoid Tautologies, nor can I produce the ſtory in due form; becauſe, in the firſt place my Judgment may be often diſorder'd with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Pleaſures paſt; in the ſecond, my memory can't anſwer the deſign of an Hiſtorian, nor a Man of Monſieur <hi>Scuddery</hi>'s Imployment. My Style will be purely natural, and every thing deliver'd in the ſame dreſs, and with as little of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:179798:47"/> Art, as if you had the Story immediately from my Mouth without Premeditation.</p>
                  <p>MY Father (Marqueſs of <hi>Huayna)</hi> dy'd in the fourth year of my Age, I remember ſome things of his Burial, but nothing elſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd him. He left me all the Eſtate he had, having none but my ſelf to ſucceed him. I ſhall paſs over in ſilence my Education, and whatever Accidents might happen in our Family, and tell you that I was in a very few years taken notice of, by all the Young Gentlemen in the City of <hi>Capac,</hi> where I then reſided; and whether it was the effect of that ſmall Beauty I poſſeſs, or the largeneſs of my Fortune, I ſhall not determine. But, before I had reach'd my twelfth Year, I cou'd ſee ſeveral ſigh for me; I was yet ſo very Young, that I ſcarce believ'd any ſuch Paſſion as Love had been incident to Mortals. I had never felt it my ſelf, and conſequently laugh'd at all thoſe who told me they cou'd Die for me.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>I liv'd at eaſe, and only felt thoſe Cares,</l>
                     <l>Which wait on Mortals in their younger Years.</l>
                     <l>I view'd ſecurely men in Tempeſts toſt,</l>
                     <l>Saw unconcern'd the buſie Mortals loſt.</l>
                     <l>Laugh'd at the Hurricane, and ſcorn'd all care,</l>
                     <l>Shrink'd up in quiet, cauſe I was not there.</l>
                     <l>Ah happy time! (if then our Bliſs we knew)</l>
                     <l>When from a-far the diſtant World we view:</l>
                     <l>We dwell with lovely Innocence and Joy,</l>
                     <l>Nor feel thoſe Paſſions which our eaſe Deſtroy.</l>
                     <l>Know no diſſembling Arts, nor dream of Love,</l>
                     <l>To which in Riper Age ſo ſoon we move.</l>

                     <l>And a long Night ſucceeds the ſhort-liv'd Day.</l>
                     <l>Unlook't for ills our rowling Years purſue,</l>
                     <l>Ages of Pain, our hours of Pleaſure few,</l>
                     <l>And ſtill old troubles giving way to new.</l>

                  <p>He who firſt found out the way to pleaſe me, was one whom Nature meant for the undoing of our Sex. To ſee him, and not to love him, were things inconſiſtent. He was ſecond Son to the Earl of <hi>Rucana,</hi> his eldeſt Brother being then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, (and not having for ſome years acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Relations with the place of his abode,) the young <hi>Adraſtus</hi> (for that's his Name) was look'd upon by all the Ladies in Town, as the ſole Heir of ſo ancient a Family; he was Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to a wonder, of good Shapes, did every thing with a ſingular Grace, was mighty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant, and knew perfectly how to pleaſe the greateſt Criticks in matter of Gallantry. He had eaſie acceſs to our Houſe; his Father was ſomething related to my Mother, and being a Widdower had made ſome advances in Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to her, the better to introduce his Son whom he deſign'd for me; upon this ſmall Relation the young <hi>Adraſtus</hi> pretended a more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Intereſt in our Family. He very often came to ſee me, and wou'd ſometimes ſtay the beſt part of the Day.; my Mother was pleas'd to ſee him deſirous of my Company, ſhe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly in Love with the Father, and forgot no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that conduc'd to the happineſs of his Son; the old Man aſſuring her 'twas the greateſt Mark ſhe cou'd give him of her Affection; ſhe commended the young Lover upon all occaſions,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:179798:48"/> whoſe bewitching behaviour was enough to move the moſt inſenſible. I ſeem'd to hear her however with indifferency, and often gave her thoſe Anſwers that ſuited nothing with my real thoughts. This made her often deſpair of making me ſenſible for a Man ſhe deſign'd her Son at any rate, and therefore at laſt perſwaded the then innocent <hi>Adraſtus</hi> (who hitherto had never ſpoke of Love to me) to try his Fortune himſelf. He often obſerv'd me very cold towards him, (tho' it proceeded from nothing but that tenderneſs I had for him, becauſe I was afraid he might perceive it) and fears much how to ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; he doubts a perpetual Baniſhment might enſue upon a Diſcovery of this Nature: And this he argu'd from my precedent ſeeming Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, while he yet remain'd in a ſtate of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and often let ſlip thoſe opportunities which made for his Advantage. This vex'd me ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and I cou'd have wiſh'd him leſs fearful (for I knew he lov'd) or my ſelf more indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. However, being hourly in my Company, he was at laſt inſpir'd with more Courage; and one day as we were in a Balcony, that hung o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Garden Wall, I chanc'd to Commend a row of Cypreſs Trees (then next our view) as the moſt pleaſant, becauſe of a Grove at one end full of curious Springs and ſome Artificial Water-works; he laid hold of this, tho' he had neglected better occaſions, and looking confus'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon me, Madam, (ſaid he) I have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd your choice of this Walk, which methinks is the moſt ſolitary in the Garden; thoſe I hated a few Months ago, but of late the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd places beſt fit my humour, and I cou'd wiſh
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:179798:48"/> your Inclinations to 'em had the ſame cauſe with that of mine. Here he ſtopt, and I believe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually fear'd my taking notice of what he had ſaid, and my neglecting on't. I ſoon perceiv'd his aim, and willing to make him believe I did not. I know not (ſaid I, looking coldly upon him) what may be the cauſe of your Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor have <hi>I</hi> hitherto obſerv'd that change in your Humour you mention. No Madam, (cry'd he, interrupting me, and with a brisker Air) had it been my Happineſs to be taken notice of by you, amongſt the common Herd of men, you had e're now ſeen that change which all the World takes notice of. The truth is, he had grown ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more reſerv'd of late, and carry'd in his Countenance the Marks of a violent Flame, this <hi>I</hi> acknowledg'd in part to him, but willing to Convert it to raillery, <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> (ſaid <hi>I</hi> ſmiling) <hi>I</hi> hope your Melancholy proceeds not from the abſence of your elder Brother, whom all men conclude long ſince in the other World; if it does, methinks you are too tender, to mourn a loſs that brings ſo great a profit. Madam, (ſaid he, with a look that pierc'd my Heart) my ſullen Humour has another Original; had you been leſs fair, <hi>I</hi> ſtill had been happy, half of thoſe Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties you poſſeſs, are ſufficient to impoſe Chains on a Heart more ſtubborn than mine. In a word, Madam, I'm your Lover, <hi>I</hi> muſt for ever be ſo, <hi>I</hi> die for you, and nothing but a return can create my Happineſs. Here he ended, with a look ſo am'rous and ſubmiſſive, 'twas enough to have Charm'd even <hi>Niobe:</hi> Nevertheleſs <hi>I</hi> feign'd a mighty diſpleaſure at the freedom he had aſſum'd; he ſaw me frown, and was juſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:179798:49"/> ready to ſpeak in his own behalf, when the old Earl and my Mother enter'd the Room, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently withdrew a conſiderable diſtance from me, with that confuſion in his Face which his Father eaſily obſerv'd; however the old Man ſeem'd to take no notice on't, yet he ſoon engag'd me to take a walk in the Garden, and taking my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Hand, left me for his Son. <hi>Adraſtus</hi> had ſo much of Love in his Eyes, that for my ſoul <hi>I</hi> cou'd not be angry with him, yet gave him my Hand without any ſigns of my being appeas'd; while we walk't, <hi>I</hi> cou'd obſerve the diſorder in which he was, a ſudden Paleneſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſpread his Face, next moment a Ruddy Bluſh betray'd his quick ſurpriſe, unuſual beating ſeiz'd his trembling Heart, and methought <hi>I</hi> felt that eager melting tenderneſs in every touch, as if his trembling Hand had reach'd my fireing Soul; he fear'd <hi>I</hi> might lay hold of the leaſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to reproach him, and therefore kep't as nigh the old Earl as poſſibly he cou'd; he was not ſo much in Love with my Mother, but that he cou'd eaſily perceive his Son's Behaviour, be gave him a look that ſhow'd his ſentiments; and then chuſing another Walk left us. <hi>Adraſtus</hi> much repented his Temerity in the diſcovery of his Flame, becauſe he fear'd <hi>I</hi> ſhould never more admit his Viſits; but ſeeing what was paſt cou'd not be recall'd, he reſolv'd to make the beſt on't. Madam ſaid he (as ſoon as they were gone) <hi>I</hi> doubt not but that you are incens'd at the Declaration I have made you, but if that can attone for the Sin I have committed, believe that nothing but invincible Neceſſity cou'd force me to tranſgreſs thoſe Bounds I have ſo long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:179798:49"/> my ſelf. I have ador'd you ſince I firſt ſaw you, even to Idolatry, and the Suppreſſion of my Flame ſo long, has only ſerv'd to make it burn with more violence.—Having thus ſaid, he conſulted my Eyes for his future Deſtiny, and I was willing to arm them with more Fury than my Inclination cou'd well permit. 'Tis impoſſible to hold out againſt thoſe we love; I had long admir'd him in ſecret, and often wiſh'd for what I was then about to deſtroy; I read Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his looks, I'm ſtraight diſarm'd, then all my Counterfeit anger in a moment leaves me; and 'twas with difficulty <hi>I</hi> cou'd hide my real Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:179798:50"/> ſo continued together till the Night Air Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to withdraw; and then we parted, both pleas'd with what had happen'd.</p>
                  <p>THE next Day he came to ſee me, <hi>I</hi> cou'd ſee a new-born Joy in all his looks, and I fancy he read very little of anger in mine. <hi>I</hi> repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heartily of that ſilence <hi>I</hi> half enjoyn'd him, often imagining with my ſelf what moving words he'd utter, were the liberty of ſpeaking granted; he eaſily perceiv'd part of that eſteem <hi>I</hi> bore him, and therefore ventur'd to whiſper in my Ears a thouſand moving things natural to a paſſionate Lover, young and eloquent; <hi>I</hi> heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to all thoſe Vows he made, with an inward Satisfaction, that ſometimes diſplay'd it ſelf in my Eyes; he came often to ſee me, proteſted a violent Love for me, and ſeldom left me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome new Addition to his hopes.</p>

But Fortune had betray'd her Nature, had ſhe been longer our Friend.<hi>—I</hi> had gone out one Evening in my Chariot with a couple of Horſes, to take the Air in a pleaſant Field, about half a Mile from the Town, <hi>I</hi> had no Footmen with me, and was attended only by my Maid <hi>Zibelline;</hi> the Sun was almoſt ſet when <hi>I</hi> cou'd perceive ſome Gentlemen coming into that Road in which <hi>I</hi> was, but unwilling to be ſeen, <hi>I</hi> order'd the Coachman to chuſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, this inſtead of anſwering my deſign led me to them, ſeveral of them paſt by me, paying only thoſe reſpects they thought due to a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of my Rank, but he who came laſt, and that by his Preſence and Furniture ſeem'd to exceed the others in Quality, ſtop't within twenty Paces of my Coach; <hi>I</hi> ſoon perceiv'd it, and at firſt judg'd he might be of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, when <hi>I</hi> came up to him he turn'd his Horſe the ſame way <hi>I</hi> drove, and looking earneſtly upon me, Madam (ſaid he) what ſtrange accidents attend us Mortals, <hi>I</hi> went out free in the Morning, perſu'd the Chaſe all Day, and in the Evening am become a Priſoner to an unknown Conqueror. <hi>I</hi> was about to have return'd a ſpeedy anſwer, that wou'd have ſuited nothing with his Quality, when <hi>I</hi> cou'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:179798:51"/> perceive by the Star on his Cloak 'twas the Duke of <hi>Minoya;</hi> he's a very handſom young Man, Fair, and of a middle Stature, but one that Loves every where, the greateſt Prince in our Country, and of no ſmall Authority; <hi>I</hi> only ſmil'd at what he ſaid, but he inſiſted on the Subject, ſwore he lov'd, and that till now he ne're had ſeen a Woman truly Charming. The Coach ſtill drove on, and he ſtill rode by it, with his Eyes fix'd on mine. When <hi>I</hi> arriv'd at the City Gates <hi>I</hi> beg'd be'd leave me, but in vain; <hi>I</hi> fretted much at the unlucky accident, I deſir'd not to be known to him, and prudently remember'd how much it endanger'd my Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to entertain for a Lover, a Man who had deceiv'd the greateſt Ladies of our Country, often obtaining the laſt Favours from them without any returns. But he wou'd not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, and <hi>I</hi> was at laſt forc'd to tell him who <hi>I</hi> was: This knowledge added a little to that reſpect he pay'd me, but was much the ſame as if he had accompany'd me home, for there were few in <hi>Capac</hi> who cou'd not inform him where the Marqueſs of <hi>Hayana</hi>'s Daughter liv'd. He came next Day and pay'd me a viſit, preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either upon his Birth, or his young acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and perhaps upon both. I was but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Campany for a Man of his buſineſs, my ſtock of Love was already ſpent, and the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt Youth in <hi>Capac</hi> wou'd have found me Bankrupt in all things but my Pity. He was not a whit daunted at this Reception how-e're un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look't for, his former ſucceſſes encouraging him to hope the like in this. About this time the Earl of <hi>Rucana</hi> dy'd of an Apoplexy, leaving his eldeſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:179798:52"/> Son to rejoyce in the Poſſeſſion of a great Eſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and my Mother to mourn the loſs of one ſhe look'd upon as her Husband. This for ſome time kept away the young <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> but cou'd not hinder the Duke from his daily viſits. My Mother knew very well of it, and eaſily believes my Beauty and Fortune ſufficient to advance me to ſo honourable a Match; and having loſt all hopes of Poſſeſſing the Father, ſhe remembers the Son no more, and imploys her Intereſt for this new and potent Lover only. In the mean time <hi>I</hi> thought of nothing but <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways writ to me, and decency no ſooner permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than he came to ſee me. <hi>I</hi> told him nothing of the Duke's viſits, <hi>I</hi> lov'd him too well to give him the knowledge of that which wou'd have made him the moſt uneaſie Man alive, and he parted from me with his uſual Satisfaction; our affairs did not long continue in this State, <hi>Adraſtus</hi> having drop't a Letter of mine, which he had receiv'd privately while in the Room with his Brother, laid the Scene for moſt of my misfortunes that follow'd; as ſoon as he could lay hold of opportunity he went into the Garden, there to read what he had newly receiv'd; but after a tedious ſearch, he at laſt concludes it loſt. The Earl had taken it up, but <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> who was very well acquainted with his Humour, knew 'twas impoſſible to make him own the Fact, and therefore came inſtantly to inform me of the accident; tho' <hi>I</hi> was ſorry my Letter had reach'd <hi>Rucana</hi>'s Hands, yet <hi>I</hi> cou'd not chuſe but ſmile at that concern <hi>Adraſtus</hi> ſhow'd for the loſs; the more he was vex'd methought he ſpoke the more of Love. <hi>Adraſtus</hi> (ſaid <hi>I,</hi> to

                     <hi>I</hi> had conceiv'd, your Beauty made me eaſily believe you the ſame my Brother ador'd; but ſince it is not ſo, let me hope my happineſs the greater, becauſe you are not prepoſſeſt in Favours of another; if it be my misfortune to be leſs in your eſteem than the young <hi>Adraſtus, I</hi> hope time and my enſuing Services may raiſe me ſome ſteps beyond him. <hi>Caſmia</hi> catch'd Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by the foretop, and laying her indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency aſide, tells him that Fame ſpoke ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently on the Earl of <hi>Rucana</hi>'s behalf, that he was a Servant the handſomeſt Lady in <hi>Capac</hi> might be proud of, and that tho' ſhe found her Heart nothing inclinable to Love, yet if time ſhou'd ſhow his Paſſion the ſame he now ſwore it was, he might perhaps o'recome that indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, which every Man had hitherto met with from her. The Earl o'rejoy'd at this ſudden change, made a thouſand Proteſtations of invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Fidelity, ſwore that his Heart was never before engag'd, and that it ſhou'd for ever wear the Chains of the fair <hi>Timandra,</hi> who alone was Miſtreſs of thoſe Charms that cou'd make it a Priſoner.

But <hi>I</hi> ſoon perceiv'd my Error; for the Earl had no ſooner left my Maid (who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Coachman to drive immediately home) than <hi>I</hi> cou'd ſee the Gentleman leap ſuddenly from behind the tree, and meet <hi>Rucana</hi> almoſt in the ſame place where the Coach had left him. Sir (cry'd he) <hi>I</hi> have been a witneſs of your happineſs. <hi>Timandra</hi> prefers you to all men living. And tho' <hi>I</hi> have long ador'd her with a Paſſion infinitely beyond what you are capable of, yet <hi>I</hi> cou'd ne're find thoſe returns You are my happy Rival, and it now remains we ſhou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide with our Swords, which is he who beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves thoſe Favours blind Love throws upon you, without reſpect to merit.<hi>—I</hi> preſently call'd to mind whoſe Voice it was, and found it to be the Duke of <hi>Minoya's, I</hi> was ready to run in between 'em to prevent that quarrel <hi>I</hi> already ſaw commenc'd; but then <hi>I</hi> conſider'd how far <hi>I</hi> endangered my Reputation, ſhou'd it be known <hi>I</hi> was in the Fields with two ſuch men as <hi>Rucana</hi> and <hi>Minoya,</hi> at ſo unſeaſonable an hour. However they took but little time for deliberation; for the Earl, without examining with whom he fought;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:179798:54"/> us'd his utmoſt Art and Strength to Chaſtiſe the inſolence of an Enemy, who had ſo boldly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted him. In a little time (to my infinite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement) I ſaw the Duke fall, while his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant (who fought with the Earl's) meeting with worſe fortune, tumbled down dead at the feet of his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rucana</hi> put up his Sword, and immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the Field: He had receiv'd no wounds, nor was his Page's fortune leſs; ſo that when he came home, <hi>Adraſtus</hi> ſaw no ſigns about him of that Tragedy he had been acting. I remain'd almoſt motionleſs with fear, I repented a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times the folly I had committed, I wiſh'd I had never Written to <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> and was even ready to dye with grief when <hi>Zibelline</hi> arriv'd; I conceal'd my trouble as much as poſſible, and ſhe having the Key of the Back door that gave us entry to the Garden, we ſoon reach'd the Houſe undiſcover'd by any. I concluded <hi>Minoya</hi> a dead Man, and therefore us'd no care for his preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I recommended ſecreſie to <hi>Zibelline</hi> and <hi>Caſmia,</hi> as to the Enterview with the Earl; but did not mention the Combat, becauſe they knew nothing of it. In the morning <hi>Adraſtus</hi> came to ſee me, and told me the Duke of <hi>Minoya</hi> was deſperately wounded, his Servant kill'd, and both found in the Field; that it was not known with whom he fought, but that his Servants ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd from ſome of his words, he had receiv'd his Wounds for a Miſtreſs of conſiderable quality. I was glad at what <hi>Adraſtus</hi> told me; becauſe I found the Duke had not only conceal'd my name, but was likewiſe ignorant of him he deem'd his Rival. Thus we ſpent part of the morning in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:179798:55"/> upon the Accident; and that ended, the charming Youth began to enquire into the cauſe of his Baniſhment: I wou'd not tell him why I had uſed him ſo, and he departed very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. When he was gone, I began to grieve for him, remembring the pains this harſh uſage wou'd bring him: I ſtraight cou'd feel them all my own, and conſulting my love, not Reaſon I ſent for him back again; he ſoon return'd, and found my humour much alter'd to his advantage. He was infinitely o'rejoy'd, and proteſted that when he went out of my Chamber, he thought to have dy'd with the thoughts of my Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency: He went home he knew not how, and that when my meſſage came to him he turn'd Sceptick, and doubted much if he was awake: This he ſpoke with an Air ſo paſſionate, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly charm'd me, I lov'd and was belov'd; we were alone, and I cou'd not forbear to teſtifie my Joy, Love wanton'd in my eyes, and eager wiſhes o'rerul'd my nodding Virtue. He well knew what 'twas to be inflam'd: He told me a thouſand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing things, and printed kiſſes at each word he ſpoke. We were ſitting upon the Beds ſide, it was yet early in the morning, and I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon me but a looſe Night-Gown, and one Petticoat of a thin Silk. The amorous young Man commended every thing about me; my Limbs I muſt confeſs ſhone through the tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Cloth, and fed his fancy with a thouſand Charms: He claſpt me gently in his trembling Arms, faulter'd in his Speech, and ſwore he dy'd for me; that it was impoſſible to endure the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent ſeparation from a Heav'n in view, and that now he muſt be bleſs'd or for ever wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:179798:55"/> that he fear'd his Brother's pretences, and nothing cou'd ſecure him but a flame equal to that of his own. 'Tis needleſs, Madam, to tell you more. I lov'd him, and cou'd deny him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Deſire grew wild, fears (the curs'd allays of Love) fled: I dream't of Joys and pleaſures yet unknown, my looſned Soul ſeem'd juſt upon the wing, and I at laſt lay yielding, melting, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in his Arms; his Soul ſat hovering o're his Balmy Lips, Love darted from his Eyes, and all the Charms of that young God were in him. Oh! kind Heav'n! let me ever remember all thoſe tender Vows he made while he lay panting and breathleſs by my ſide, and bluſh'd at what was paſt; then ſtrove to bring the haſty Joy again. Thus he obtain'd that favour, which ne're be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd in Youth, is frozen up by Icy Age, and lyes unregarded, till we are render'd incapable of thoſe Bleſſings men wou'd give, and Women can receive. We gave mutual aſſurances of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual fidelity, and parted both of us ſatisfied of others Love.</p>

                  <p>Theſe thoughts did not then poſſeſs me, tho' I found the truth of them too late, and 'twas when my misfortunes gave me melancholy hours, that my Muſe ſung ſo gravely.</p>
                  <p>The Earl came privately, and paid his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to the ſuppos'd <hi>Timandra;</hi> he concluded himſelf happy from what the Duke told him, and courted with a brisker Air than was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to him; I had order'd <hi>Caſmia</hi> ſtill to deceive him. He was of a cloſe temper, truſted no Man with what was by himſelf reputed worthy of Secreſie; and when he ſaw his Miſtreſs, he came without Attendants. About this time <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſtus,</hi> who lov'd not the Earl's melancholy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, left his houſe, and choſe Lodgings for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which chanc'd to be very nigh thoſe of the Duke of <hi>Minoya's,</hi> and therefore often paid him a viſit during his ſickneſs. <hi>Adraſtus</hi> was of an oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing temper; and ſo far gain'd the Duke's eſteem, that he cou'd never be eaſie when without him. While he, to repay this kindneſs, was ſeldom ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but when his Love to me requir'd it. We liv'd very happy, and <hi>Adraſtus</hi> had nothing to fear or complain of: He poſſeſs'd all that Love and Beauty could beſtow, without the proſpect of a coming ill. Sometimes he would tell me he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:179798:56"/> heard of his Brother's viſits to me; but I aſſur'd him I had never ſeen him, and ſoon calm'd thoſe ſtorms his growing Jealouſies had rais'd.</p>
                  <p>One day when he came to wait upon the Duke, he found him worſe than he had been for ſome days, and judging it the effect of ſomething more than his wounds, beg'd he wou'd impart the cauſe. <hi>Minoya,</hi> after he had Commanded his Servants to quit the Room; my Dear <hi>Adraſtus</hi> (ſaid he) thoſe wounds you ſee are nothing, if compar'd with the Torments of my Soul, I Love the Young Marchioneſs of <hi>Huyana,</hi> I ſaw her that night I came to <hi>Capac,</hi> and have wore her Chains ever ſince, whoſe weight is nothing yet diminiſh'd; tho I've ſeen others happy, even then when ſhe ſtrove to perſuade me ſhe ne're had nor could love any Man. <hi>Adraſtus</hi> was ſurpiz'd at what he heard, and if the Duke had in the leaſt ſuſpected him, he wou'd have read in his face-how much he was intereſted in the Story. He durſt ſcarce deſire him to finiſh what he had begun, ſo much he fear'd to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Infidelity of her he lov'd. But the other to ſave him that labour proceeded, and in few words told him all that concern'd the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter he had that Evening he receiv'd his Wounds. <hi>Adraſtus</hi> ſoon believ'd 'twas his Brother, he remember'd 'twas the ſame day in which he had loſt my Letter, calls to mind the abſence I enjoyn'd him; and at laſt concludes me guilty. When men once become Maſters by Enjoyment, Mole-Hills appear Mountains, and that which before cou'd render them happy, now they look upon as a thing uſeleſs and injurious to their repoſe; they think Women ſhou'd from
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:179798:57"/> that moment abandon all Appetites but thoſe they entertain for them. And like wretched Miſers graſp at all, then ſigh when they can hold no more, and murmur becauſe another may enjoy what they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone wou'd poſſeſs. The Jealous <hi>Adraſtus</hi> hides his pain as much as poſſible from the Duke, and tells him that ſhe whom he ador'd was truly the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt Woman in <hi>Capac,</hi> and one who wou'd in time regard the Services of a Prince, who me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the eſteem of all Mankind; that he had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times ſeen me when his Father was alive, and that he ſhou'd not fail to do him ſome good Offices upon the ſmall acquaintance he had, did not a very urgent buſineſs command his abſence for ſome time. The Duke gave him a thouſand thanks for his kind offer, and in the mean time, tho' he was ſorry for his departure, wiſh'd him a good Journey. <hi>Adraſtus</hi> went to his Lodgings, poſſeſs'd with Love, Anger, Jealouſie, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; thus paſſion o're-rul'd his Judgment, and in that weakneſs he ſent me this Letter.</p>

                  <p>I was at firſt all fury, I term'd him the moſt ingrateful of men, my paſſion ſuggeſted a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand things to me, I was ſorry for the Happineſs <hi>I</hi> had given, and heartily wiſh'd my Love had been more moderate. But Love that ſeldom loſeth poſſeſſion in an honeſt Heart, reaſſumes his Empire, and repreſents the miſtaken Lover Sorrowful, and Paſſionate; Jealous by a ſeeming guilt, and deſperate at his own loſs. <hi>I</hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Letter partially, and thought there was ſtill ſo much of Love in every line, that it ſhone through all thoſe Clouds his Jealouſie and Anger had contracted, and began in earneſt to mourn his loſs; grief took place of former Joys, and <hi>I</hi> have wept ſometimes whole Nights, and curs'd thoſe Stars that forc'd me to love a Man <hi>I</hi> had ſo many reaſons to purſue with my hatred. My Mother wonder'd what might work this ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain alteration in my humour; and imagin'd my grief aroſe from the Duke of <hi>Minoya</hi>'s miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and doubted not but that <hi>I</hi> lov'd him; for by the help of my Maid <hi>Zibelline, Adraſtus</hi> was ſeldom ſeen come or go from my Houſe, ſo that ſhe neither ſuſpected him nor the Earl, who was ſtill very cautious in his viſits. <hi>I</hi> was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (the better to conceal my misfortune) to let things appear the ſame ſhe took them for, and in the mean time forgot not to uſe thoſe ways that promis'd any likelihood of recalling the Object of all my wiſhes.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:179798:58"/>
                  <p> One Night while <hi>I</hi> ſat all alone in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>I</hi> could hear ſoft whiſpers at the Door; my Curioſity was augmented when <hi>I</hi> thought, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the Earl of <hi>Rucana</hi>'s Voice; when <hi>I</hi> had look'd through the Key-hole, <hi>I</hi> found <hi>I</hi> had not judg'd amiſs. He was looking very earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his ſuppoſed <hi>Timandra;</hi> while ſhe on the other hand ſeem'd not to curb his hopes, for he cou'd eaſily read a fire in her Eyes equal to his own. However ſhe beg'd that this Night he wou'd abreviate his diſcourſe; adding, ſhe was afraid her Mother might find him in the Houſe. He anſwered, that he cou'd not leave her ſo ſoon, her Mother was then a-bed, and that all ſhe urg'd for his departure, was not of force ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make him delay the poſſeſſion of a Bliſs he had ſo long promis'd to himſelf. In the end ſhe was o'recome, and ſuffer'd her ſelf to be led along the Gallery, and down a pair of back Stairs into the Garden, where they enter'd a Chamber in which <hi>I</hi> often lay when the Seaſon was exceſſively hot: My Mother's Apartment was very nigh to it, and had a Balcony from her dining Room exactly oppoſite to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Door. <hi>I</hi> wanted to ſee the Earl's manner of Courtſhip, and long'd to know upon what terms he ſtood with his <hi>Timandra:</hi> (My grief for the abſence of my Lover having long kept me from the knowledge of what I had formerly us'd for my diverſion) And therefore <hi>I</hi> laid all Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of danger aſide, and ſtole privately after them. They ſeated themſelves at firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly upon the Bed, and <hi>I</hi> cou'd ſoon perceive more between 'em than a nice Virtue cou'd well allow. I was heartily diſpleas'd at what <hi>Caſmia</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:179798:58"/> did, and tho' the Earl was a cloſe minded Man, I was afraid Stones and Buſhes might have Ears to diſcloſe the intrigue. I wiſh'd he had known whom he lov'd, and was juſt about to ſhow him his errour, when they aroſe, and went ſoftly to that part of the Garden where ſhe ordinarily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him. I enter'd the Room immediately; but good Gods! how much was I amaz'd, when I ſaw my Mother had got there before me; having enter'd at the ſame Door from which they went out: She was paſſionate even to madneſs, and tho' I knew my ſelf innocent, yet I had ſcarce the power to tell her ſo; ſhe told me the Bed beſpoke ſome am'rous dalliance; that ſhe had ſeen me enter, and thereupon drawing the Curtains aſide, ſhe took up the Earl's Pocket Book, which he unfortunately had dropp'd. I was a maz'd at the accident, and preſently ſaw my Letter to <hi>Adraſtus</hi> taken out of it Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſaid ſhe, (looking furiouſly upon me) are theſe the effects of that care <hi>I</hi> have had of you? Is this the Journey <hi>Adraſtus</hi> has undertaken? Never ſee me more, you have abandon'd Virtue, you have ruin'd your Fortune, and, in a Word, are become the ſcorn of your Sex This ſaid, ſhe flung immediately out at the Back door, which ſtood half open, not doubting but that <hi>Adraſtus</hi> was gone that way; ſhe found <hi>Caſmia</hi> returning, and concluded I had ſent her to ſhow him the way. The Maid was infinitely ſurpris'd at ſo unexpected a meeting, and falling upon her knees, firſt begs a thouſand Pardons, and then tells the whole truth of the matter. This ſerves her not in any ſtead, my Mother aſſures her ſelf I'm guilty, and believes that this ſtory had been
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:179798:59"/> handſomely contriv'd to be made uſe of upon the firſt diſcovery, and ſo inſtantly thruſt her out of Doors, to find new Lodgings, and a new Miſtreſs. When ſhe came back to me, ſhe found me drown'd in Tears, tho' they proceeded more from the loſs of <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> than from my new misfortune, ſhe ſoon told me how ſhe had ſerv'd my Confident, (as ſhe call'd her); adding (ſeeing me about to ſpeak) that I ſhou'd not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to juſtifie my ſelf, becauſe my guilt was too obvious to thoſe of the leaſt judgment, and ſo left me to my ſoliloquies.</p>
                  <p>I was not ignorant of my Mother's humour, and therefore (being awak'd from that ſurpriſe into which her preſence had caſt me) without further reflections on the matter, went to Bed. There it was that I began narrowly to ſearch into my own Circumſtances, and found that tho' I was innocent of what was then laid to my Charge, yet my Conduct had been ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd reproof. I ſaw no hopes of <hi>Adraſtus</hi> his return, and fear'd the Earl might boaſt of an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Conqueſt, to thoſe who wou'd apprehend it real: Theſe and a thouſand ſuch thoughts poſſeſs'd me; when as Day began to break, I cou'd hear ſome body knock gently at my Door. I ſoon quitted my Bed, and having open'd it (for melancholy had ſo ſeiz'd me, I ne're examin'd who it was, nor did I remember the want of my Night-gown). A Gentleman caught me in his Arms, my Charming Fair (cry'd he in a tranſport, and forcing a kiſs from me) how oft have I wiſh'd for this happy minute. He ſaid no more, his ſighs, ſhort breathings, and eager embraces ſerv'd to convince me how much he
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:179798:59"/> wanted that happineſs he now thought himſelf almoſt Maſter of. However I was juſt ready to cry out, when my fears on a ſuddain interpos'd, and opportunely told me, that by ſo doing I ſhou'd confirm my Mother in her ſuſpicions; in this thought I forc'd my ſelf from his Arms, and leap'd into the Bed. He follow'd with the trembling ſteps of a burning Lover, and was beginning to undreſs, when I (with more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration than the accident cou'd well allow) told him that the calmneſs with which <hi>I</hi> receiv'd him proceeded more from a tenderneſs of my own Reputation, than Compliance to his paſſion, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he might ſoon have felt the effects of that rudeneſs of which no diſcreet Perſon wou'd be guilty. He ſoon knew by my voice that it was not his belov'd <hi>Timandra</hi> (for 'twas the Earl) and ſo without the leaſt Apology with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew.</p>
                  <p>This Accident augmented my grief; a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times did I wiſh I had ne're been guilty of that fatal interview at the Lake, it loſt me the Man I lov'd, and who (notwithſtanding of his ingratitude) was ſtill dear to me as Life it ſelf: it had brought the Duke's Wounds, and the Earl's addreſſes to my Maid, which now I found more dang'rous than if they had been to my ſelf. In the Morning I told <hi>Zibelline</hi> what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who immediately found out that Relief I ſo much wiſh'd.</p>
                  <p>She preſently ſent for <hi>Caſmia,</hi> and after we had deliberately weigh'd the buſineſs, there was a Billet-deux privately convey'd to the Earl, in which he was bid come at Night, and at the uſual hour. He fail'd not in his Obedience, and the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:179798:60"/> time was no ſooner come, than <hi>I</hi> cou'd hear him upon the Stairs. His Miſtreſs preſently gave him admittance, and play'd that part <hi>I</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd her to the Life. Madam, I'm ſo much yours that I won't offer to conceal the leaſt of my thoughts, however faulty you may find them; I muſt confeſs, <hi>I</hi> then wiſh'd he had lov'd the real <hi>Timandra.</hi> His Words were very tender, Love bask'd and wanton'd in his Eyes, and <hi>I</hi> cou'd hear him ſay all thoſe things we take for indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſigns of a violent and tender flame. But no longer to detain you on this Subject, know, that next Morning they were Marry'd. I had ſo order'd it (leſt a quick diſcovery might be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient) that they ſhou'd for ſome time Lodge in my own Appartment, which in a little time produc'd a very odd Adventure. And 'twas thus.</p>
                  <p>My Maid <hi>Zibelline</hi> lay next door to my Chamber (which the Earl then poſſeſs'd, tho' privately) and had a Lover unknown to me, who it ſeems ador'd his Goddeſs in the dark, is the Ancients did <hi>Bacchus</hi> in the night. The unknown happy-Lover, that night after the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, came to perform his ordinary Devotions, and being a ſtranger to the Houſe, without the help of Lights ſtumbl'd into that of the Earl's. <hi>Caſmia</hi> (or rather the Counteſs of <hi>Rucana)</hi> you may be ſure was kept awake with the hopes of a coming Bliſs; but dream't of nothing more than her Husband. While he (who was accuſtom'd to ſilence) leap'd into the Bed without many words. In the mean time the Earl, who laid ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been in his new Room (that morning in which he catch'd me naked excepted) fairly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:179798:60"/> dropt into that of <hi>Zibelline's,</hi> and ſo to Bed. Thus poſted, the four Lovers ſpent the Night happy in their ignorance. The Earl had upon him all the fervour and heat of a young Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, and the other all the Pleaſures of a ſtol'n Bliſs. But Day approaching, <hi>Zibelline</hi> deſir'd her Lover (or rather <hi>Rucana)</hi> to quit the Bed. He who was now marry'd, and conſequently ſecure of his Miſtreſs's favours, began already to play the Husband; that is, loſe all reſpect and good manners; ſwore he wou'd not, nor cou'd he then leave ſo many Joys unfiniſh'd, of that number he had promis'd to himſelf, without a torment equal to that of Death: And that no Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances whatſoever were of force enough to rob a Husband of his Wife, that Formalities were now of no uſe, and ſhe might frankly own her Marriage to all the World. The Maid was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expreſſion ſurpris'd at what ſhe heard, and preſently underſtood who it was that ſpoke, and whom he meant; but being of a prompt and ready Wit, counterfeited the voice of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, and, after ſome few Embraces and kind Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, at laſt prevail'd. <hi>Zibelline's</hi> Lover, who remember'd with what hazard he ſtole his favours, made no delays, and came out of the Chamber juſt as the Earl was paſſing by the Door, and ſtumbling upon him, concludes himſelf betray'd, and the Reputation of his Miſtreſs in evident dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But endeavouring to make his eſcape, he was forc'd to tumble <hi>Rucana</hi> down ſtairs, to clear his paſſage. The Earl no ſooner came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than he as ſoon aſcended, but by degrees, not as he went down; and perſwading himſelf that he who had thus ſerv'd him, was ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:179798:61"/> of his Wife's, enters her Room in a fury, much akin to a real madneſs. She, who was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd to ſee him return ſo ſoon, very kindly ask'd what was the matter? adding, that juſt now he had left her, without the happineſs of a word at parting; and that the whole Night was ſpent in ſilence, at which ſhe could not chuſe but wonder, ſince it argu'd that his Lordſhip's Love did not ſuit with his paſt Proteſtations. Ha (cry'd he) did I leave you without words? No, Madam, you urg'd my departure frequently. And now it is I underſtand why you did ſo. Your Lover came too ſoon, and I ſtaid too long, either for his Happineſs or my own. My Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (whom the Earl's fall had awak'd) with a Candle in her hand, juſt as he pronounced the laſt words, enter'd, crying out, Heav'ns! where was her Daughter? The Earl, raving anſwer'd, here! And I'm ſorry, Madam, you look'd no better to her Education, ſince I am deſtin'd to be the unhappy Man, that muſt undergo that puniſhment your neglect deſerv'd. She view'd him ſeriouſly, and knowing who it was, ask'd him what he meant, and if he was awake? if ſo, what had brought him to her Houſe at an hour ſo unſeaſonable? He bids her enquire of her Daughter, and points to the Bed. She told him he ſtill dream't, and that ſhe cou'd ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſtinguiſh her Daughter from one of her Maids: But withal ask'd the trembling and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted <hi>Caſmia,</hi> how ſhe came there, and if ſhe remember'd what had paſt the preceeding Night? And thereupon (giving way to her paſſion) pulls the poor Counteſs by the Hair from the Bed, where ſhe had lain ſilent, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:179798:61"/> half dead with fear. The Earl (tho' o're<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with Jealouſie) cou'd not ſee his Wife ſo ill us'd, and therefore reliev'd her from the paw of the Lyoneſs. In the mean time, <hi>Zibel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> had awak'd me, and (diſſembling her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the cauſe) told me the Houſe was all in an uproar: I ſoon got up, and enter'd the Room juſt as <hi>Rucana</hi> had reliev'd the diſtreſs'd fair one. My Mother, as ſoon as ſhe ſaw me; ask'd if I was a ſtranger to the cauſe of all this confuſion, and if I held a Correſpondence with the Earl, equal to that I did with <hi>Adraſtus.</hi> I told her I had never ſeen <hi>Rucana;</hi> but was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, he had endeavour'd to debauch one of my Maids; I hop'd ſhe did not doubt my Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and that my Conduct had been ſuch, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came hers and the Marqueſs of <hi>Huyana</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Earl (who had hearkned with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and amazement) ſoon found how he had been impos'd upon; and was at firſt confounded, and oppreſs'd with ſhame and anger: But then growing calm, and eying his Wife, who lay drown'd in tears with all her Beautys open to his view; his fury fled, Love pleads in her behalf, and a thouſand tender thoughts poſſeſs'd his Soul. He beheld a Woman whom he long had lov'd; half naked, weeping, proſtrate at his feet, and all her Sexes beſt bewitching Charms about her. Tears dropt from his Eyes, and all the pains of love and ſorrow jointly preſt his Heart. Then raiſing gently the afflicted fair one, he beg'd a thouſand pardons for his indiſcreet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, ſwore he ſhou'd ne're repent the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py miſtake; kiſs'd away her Tears, and ſigh'd at every word. After ſome minutes thus ſpent;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:179798:62"/> he made an Apology to my Mother, for that diſturbances he had occaſioned in the Family; then taking the Counteſs by the hand, led her down ſtairs, calls a Coach, (for 'twas now day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light) and drives home, pleas'd becauſe he lov'd.</p>
                  <p>My Mother was glad to find me innocent, and her ſelf doubly deceiv'd; and by her Joy in ſome meaſure atton'd for the harſh uſage I had receiv'd from her the foregoing Night. <hi>Zibel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> was pleas'd with her own good ſucceſs; and I thought my ſelf fortunate, in ſeeing a buſineſs I dreaded brought to a happy exit. Thus we all went to Bed again, well ſatisfied with what had hapen'd, and each of us big with the hopes of Fortune's continu'd ſmiles.</p>
                  <p>Next Day I was inform'd the Duke had quit his Room, and was able to take a turn in the Garden. The Earl's Marriage was ſoon known, and as it happens in ſuch caſes, he was laugh'd at by the Wits, pity'd by the Honeſt-hearted, and commended by the Judicious, for that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration he had ſhown in ſo provoking a juncture; and <hi>I</hi> was by all concluded privy to the intrigue. <hi>Minoya</hi> ſhow'd his Sentiments in his Eyes, where the inward Satisfaction this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent gave him viſibly appear'd: His flame is augmented with his hopes, and the removal of a Rival he thinks a ſtep to his Happineſs. Theſe pleaſant thoughts Contribute much to his ſpeedy Recovery, he imagin'd I was not prepoſſeſs'd to his prejudice, and eaſily believ'd he had fought for my Maid.</p>
                  <p>In a few days he came to ſee me, and I hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſome meaſure laid aſide the thoughts of my ingrateful Lover, receiv'd him more kindly than
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:179798:62"/> I had done before his long abſence. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd him more; my Mother ſeconded every word he ſpoke, and 'twas impoſſible to hold out againſt two ſuch powerful Aſſailants. Yet Young <hi>Adraſtus</hi> took his place by turns; and tho' the paſſion I had for him ſeem'd ſometimes dead, yet (from what thought I know not) it (like Lamps juſt extinguiſh'd) greedily catch'd hold of light, and in a moment, turn'd into a flame.</p>
                  <p>Thus divided, (after I had ſeen the Duke languiſhing for me three whole Months) I at laſt conſented to Marry him: He was raviſh'd at the wiſh'd-for grant; and taſted all thoſe Joys ſucceſsful Love imparts to Youth impatient of delays. On the other hand, I ſaw the fatal hour approach with pain, and cou'd not think of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ever his, while <hi>Adſtraſtus</hi> was in Being, tho' abſent and unkind; but not knowing how to recal that promiſe I had given, (and the Town already too buſie with my Name,) I was forc'd to confirm it by a Marriage Vow.</p>
                  <p>The Duke (now happy in the poſſeſſion of her he ador'd) went ſeldom abroad; he was uneaſie but when in my Company, and all his actions center'd in his Love. One Evening he told me, (Laughing) with what concern he had ſeen the Earl of <hi>Rucana</hi>'s happineſs, that Night he fought him, and wonder'd much how that Marriage came to paſs, ask'd if the Counteſs was handſome, and applauded her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magement. I gave her thoſe praiſes her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deſerv'd; and wiſh'd him reconcil'd to <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana,</hi> becauſe his conſtant Love, after ſo great
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:179798:63"/> a diſappointment, ſpoke him a Man truly noble, of a great Soul, fix'd and ſteady in his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; generous, good natur'd, and of honeſt Principles. And the truth is, ſo great a change was never known, as that which Love and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage had wrought on this Man; his Soul ſeem'd new-moulded, and imprinted with all the marks of Virtue, Honour, and Nobility. Whate're I ſpoke was a Law, and if I had but the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to any thing, 'twas immediately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd; ſo that my Husband next day, waited for nothing more than an opportunity of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Earl, but finding none, at laſt went to his Houſe. <hi>Rucana</hi> receiv'd him, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd his friendſhip with all the Sincerity which Man can be Maſter of, when he pays his Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Heaven. They diſcours'd long of things indifferent, and at laſt came to the Subject of their quarrel; where the kind Huband ſpoke ſo advantagiouſly of his Wife, that he charm'd the Duke into an extaſie. She who had not forgot what once ſhe was, kept a modeſt humility in all her actions, look'd ſweet and languſhing, and made it her only ſtudy how to pleaſe the Lord of all her wiſhes. With this bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate ſhe enter'd the Room, where <hi>Minoya</hi> pay'd her thoſe reſpects due to the Counteſs of <hi>Rucana,</hi> and the Wife of his Friend; from the Earl's diſcourſe, he had form'd a lovely Idea of this hppy fair one, and was pleaſantly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd, to ſee how far the ſweet Original out-did that Picture he had newly drawn. He intended at firſt no more than a ſhort viſit; but the Earl's kindneſs, and the Charms of his Wife, made him forget that Reſolution. When he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:179798:63"/> came home, his wonted joys flag'd, his appetite ſeem'd pal'd, he look'd uneaſie, as if ſome ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den illneſs had ſeiz'd him; thought much, ſpoke little, and the torments of his Soul (after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny endeavours to hide them) were at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous. I was ſenſibly griev'd at this new miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, tho' I yet knew not what it was; I us'd all the moving Arts of Honeſt Love to Charm him into mirth, and wreſtled even with vritue how to pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>He ſtill continues all Ice; reſtleſs in his thoughts, divided from himſelf, forgetting all his former Vows and me. He went every day to <hi>Rucana</hi>'s, return'd more cold, and all the World at laſt took notice of it. I knew my ſelf Young and Handſom, fitted by Nature to inflame deſire; and was all madneſs, at the thoughts of loſing an Heart I had begun to value in earneſt; but that which moſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly diſpleas'd me was, to find my ſelf aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd for one that had been my Servant, and whom (by my own folly) I had advanc'd to all Happineſs ſhe then poſſeſs'd.</p>
                  <p>Things were thus, when my Melancholy and the calm Evening (the Duke being then at <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana</hi>'s) invited me to a walk in the Garden. There it was I began to remember my joys paſt, the Cypreſs Trees brought the fugitive <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſtus</hi> to my view, with all his Charms about him, and repreſented the Duke the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful of men; Revenge ſpoke Peace to my Soul, and a thouſand different reſolutions (the effects of my reſtleſs mind) poſſeſs'd me, and next moment were deſtroy'd by that ſame power which gave them firſt a Being. Thus
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:179798:64"/> my Heart at laſt beat it ſelf to reſt; and while I lay upon a Moſſy Bank, and all my ſorrows chain'd in peaceful ſlumbers; I dream't (nay, methought it was no dream, ſuch ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions the bleſt Viſion made) my abſent Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſighing by me lay, all drown'd in ſorrow for his loſs, wept, then wiſh'd me falſe, ſo I but lov'd him now. I wak'd, but 'twas to ſee what my Eyes had often long'd for. The love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Youth threw himſelf at my feet, gaz'd, and ſigh'd, and labour'd with his pain. My ſorrow equal'd his, and tho' I oft had wiſh'd the wand'rer back, the cruel thought of being his no more daſht all my Joys, and turn'd them into Tears. Thus on each other for a while we gaz'd, breath'd ſhort, and trembled while we ſtrove to ſpeak. At laſt his Courage bore away his grief, and looſened by degrees, that ſoft be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching Tongue, whoſe Eloquence ſo often had undone me; and ſaid, Can you be mine no more? Can you be cruel to a repenting Sinner, who for pardon ſues, and damn me to a new Hell of abſence, more laſting than the firſt? Is <hi>Adraſtus</hi> quite forgot? And muſt the Duke poſſeſs a Heav'n alone? Ah! (cry'd I! when my Tears wou'd give me leave to ſpeak) I Love and fear my own weakneſs; but as you tender my future Happineſs, ask no more than a Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wife ſhou'd give. Has the Dutcheſs of <hi>Minoya</hi> nothing of <hi>Timandra</hi> in her, (reply'd he, interrupting me) and can you reſolve to ſee me dye? I beg'd with Tears he'd urge his Love no more; and at laſt, promiſing to meet him there next Evening, we parted.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:179798:64"/>
                  <p> When the Duke came home, I found his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour the ſame it had been for ſome Months pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. However, I did not lay his indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency in that ballance it formerly held; my Love grew lighter, and that eſteem I had for him, became hourly leſs. Next Evening <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſtus</hi> came, and I fail'd not to meet him; his Soul ſeem'd more at reſt, but his Love the ſame. After ſome ſerious diſcourſe, I ask'd him how he had ſpent the time of his abſence, and if no new Beauty had raz'd me from his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. The lovely Penitent cou'd deny me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and began the Relation immediately: Which, Madam, you may take as followeth, becauſe 'tis occaſion'd by the ſtory of my Love.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <p>AFter I had Written that Letter, (where Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rul'd, and my Judgment or Gratitude were not conſulted) I took Horſe that Evening, and began my journey to <hi>Chira,</hi> (the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis of <hi>Naitrant)</hi> where I have ſtaid ever ſince my departure. I was a ſtranger to the City, and the firſt Bill <hi>I</hi> read, there I took up my Lodgings. I liv'd ſometime in the Houſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and went very ſeldom abroad; my grief for ſo great a loſs hourly imploying my thoughts. But one day going to take the Air upon the River at the back of the City, I encountred ſome Young Ladies that walk'd upon the Banks, and ask'd, if they deſign'd to truſt themſelves to the water? Women there, tho' Virtuous and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, yet are not ſhie, and being well bred, know how to oblige ſtrangers, and preſerve their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. They accepted the Complement; and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:179798:65"/> having got Muſick on board, we ſpent the day, and ſome part of the Evening very pleaſantly; and at laſt began the ſtories of our Loves, where I related mine (but conceal'd your Name and Quality) with as much pain, as if we had but newly parted; this mov'd the pity of all the Ladies, and ſhe who was the faireſt of them (and whom we could not perſwade to a relation of her Adventures) wept; and ſighing, ſaid, I deſerv'd better fortune. Thus we conſum'd the time, and I proffer'd to ſee them to their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but was deny'd the Honour, tho' not before they had aſſur'd me that I might fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſee them, where we had met that Forenoon.</p>
                     <p>I found ſomething that night at my Heart more than uſual, and tho' my own misfortunes lay heavy upon me, I was afflicted for thoſe Tears I had forc'd the fair one to ſhed, and cou'd have almoſt wiſh'd my ſelf in Love with her: Her tenderneſs ſpoke good Nature, and her gen'rous pity ſhow'd a noble Soul. Your ſeeming infidelity urg'd me to forget my Vows, and my griefs bid me ſeek relief from ſome kinder ſhe. Then after a tedious conteſt, I was all Love, all Repentance, and every corner of my Soul was full of thee; <hi>Timandra,</hi> was the Object of my waking thoughts, and the laſt guide that led me to my reſt; all Night I'd dream of her, and in the Morning mourn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I cou'd dream no more.</p>
                     <p>Next day however, I went to renew my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with my laſt days walk, I mov'd without deſign, yet wanted to ſee them; I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:179798:65"/> fear'd, and wiſh'd, and wanted I knew not what; I fled from my ſelf, I ask'd not whither; and when I moſt reſolv'd to ſhake off my ſorrows, and ſeek for Happineſs in a new Love, I've found a pleaſure in my preſent pain, and doated on my griefs for the ſake of her who brought them. But the fair ones no ſooner arriv'd, than all my cares were huſht, ſorrow ſlept, and no Melancholy thought diſturb'd my dawning Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. I cou'd look on my new acquaintance with an' air wholly chang'd, and obſerv'd that the faireſt often fixed her Eyes on mine; and when ſhe ſpoke, Love and Modeſty ſhar'd all her words between them. But time (which to unthinking Lovers ſtill ſeems ſhort) flew quick away, and Night with all her gloomy ſhades ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, the Ladies retir'd to their reſpective Lodgings.</p>
                     <p>The tender-hearted fair one, after ſome ſmall refuſals, at laſt permits me to wait upon her to hers. My thoughts were ſo pleaſantly imploy'd, I ne're examin'd the way ſhe choſe, and was ſurpris'd to ſee her ſtop at mine. I beg'd ſhe'd allow me the Happineſs of waiting upon her to hers, and ſhe told me, <hi>I</hi> had already done ſo. Thus we parted, and <hi>I</hi> enter'd ſome time after, without acquainting her that <hi>I</hi> lodg'd in the ſame Houſe. A few minutes after, my Heart ſeem'd entirely hers, and when it had for a while enjoy'd it ſelf with the thoughts of a new Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and judg'd the Conqueſt paſt, its firſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs wou'd return, recall the wand'rer, and force him to obedience; and the fair <hi>Timan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi> ſtill poſſeſs'd a Heart, in ſpight of its owner.</p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:179798:66"/>
                     <p> We often met, and the Charming <hi>Olmechine,</hi> (for that was the name of this kind fair one) at laſt let me know ſhe lov'd. But did it with all the modeſty of her Sex, ſhow'd a ſtrong and nice Virtue, with a powerful Love; paleneſs o'reſpread her Face, trembling dwelt upon her Lips, her Eyes were fix'd upon the ground, and her Words were moving, but her Beauty more. 'Twas then, that Love ſhow'd himſelf a capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Deity; for the Maid no ſooner had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd my Heart, than 'twas entirely yours. <hi>I</hi> had Eyes no more for her, and my inclinations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly chang'd, <hi>I</hi> receiv'd the tender ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs with more indifferency, than good breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or gratitude cou'd well allow. However, when <hi>I</hi> had recollected my ſelf, <hi>I</hi> gave her all that Satisfaction ſhe cou'd juſtly expect from a heart ſhe knew wholly prepoſſeſt, and now firmly fortified againſt a change, <hi>I</hi> ſee her home at Night, and inform her, that <hi>I</hi> lodg'd in the ſame Houſe, ſhe bluſh'd at the unexpected adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and tho' ſhe lov'd, was ſorry to know a Man under the ſame Roof with her ſelf, that was conſcious to her weakneſs. Next day <hi>I</hi> din'd with her, where <hi>I</hi> made my acquaintance with her Aunt; and whom <hi>I</hi> found to be the Miſtreſs of the Family. The old Gentlewoman entertain'd me very kindly, and commended my ſhape, mien, and garb, with all the gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, of which one at twenty is capable; and <hi>I</hi> return'd her Complements with that careleſs gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, to which my griefs permitted me not to be a ſtranger. At night ſhe came to my Room; and under the notion of asking, if things were in that order <hi>I</hi> wiſh'd them, ſpent ſome
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:179798:66"/> hours in my Company. <hi>I</hi> cou'd obſerve, while ſhe ſtay'd, that nothing pleas'd her ſo much, as when the Subject was Love: The Blood ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led through her buff Cheeks, and Love lay burning in her deadned Eyes. Next day I found her painted and dreſs'd, with that gallantry that only fitted Brides of fifteen, and I was a ſecond time oblig'd to accept of a ſplendid Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from her. Thus ſhe continu'd kind, and every day gave me new grounds of ſuſpecting the old Letcher inflam'd. While the Aunt made daily advances, the lovely Niece ſaw me but ſeldom; and when ſhe did, 'twas with all the baſhfulneſs of a guilty young ſinner, whoſe Virtue had newly been ſeduc'd. <hi>I</hi> paid her all thoſe reſpects ſhe deſerv'd, and gave my Pity when <hi>I</hi> had no more. She'd ſigh, look pale, and gently hang her head; then leave me ſad, becauſe <hi>I</hi> cou'd not love. <hi>Attabalippa,</hi> (for that was the Aunt's name) in time became a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect plague, ſhe haunts me like a Ghoſt, my Will and Actions ſeem the guide of hers, and ſhe does nothing, in which her hopes to pleaſe me has not a ſhare. This made me look out for new Lodgings, and <hi>I</hi> was ready to depart, when my Servant <hi>Curacas</hi> came and told me, the fair <hi>Olmechine</hi> lay dangerouſly ill of a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; at this a ſudden tenderneſs ſeiz'd me, Pity and fears lodg'd in my Breaſt, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Torments rack'd me till I ſaw her. <hi>I</hi> ſoon got admittance, and (having ſeated my ſelf by her upon the Bed) enquir'd paſſionately after her health; the Charming Innocent wept, and ſigh'd, then looking upon me with Eyes all Languiſhing, anſwer'd, <hi>I</hi> am—At this a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:179798:67"/> new flood of Tears broke forth, and all the Charms of Beauty in diſtreſs aſſault my Heart, and mov'd a pity equal even to Love. Then taking hold of her fair hand, that lay above the Cloaths, <hi>I</hi> kiſs'd it with all the Tranſports new-born flames cou'd give; conjur'd her to ſpeak, I long'd to ſhare her griefs; and almoſt wiſh'd my ſelf the Cauſe, to have the Power of giving ſome relief. Thus while <hi>I</hi> mourn'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her, poſſeſs'd with all the tenderneſs of dying Mothers, for their weeping infants, I cou'd ſee her Lips (like Roſes pluckt) grow pale, her Heart beat thick, and night o'reſpread her Eyes, her Soul half fled, and ſhe at laſt lay fainting in my Arms. This adds to my ſorrow, and lab'ring 'twixt grief and Love, <hi>I</hi> gently rais'd her drooping Head, and ſtrove to kiſs her back again to Life; my ſighs ecchoed in her ears, and my groans awak'd her from this little death. She look'd upon me with all the Symptoms of a Love-ſick Maid, and bluſh'd to find her ſelf ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my Boſom, with half her Beauties open; then faintly ſtrugling, threw her ſelf down upon the Bed. Ah! Sir, (ſaid ſhe) for Heav'ns ſake, think me Virtuous, tho' you've found me weak; tenderneſs for your loſs firſt begot my Love, then uſe it as the darling Child of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous paſſion, and not the effect of a mind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd; pardon the exceſs of a flame ſo pure, and give me pity, if you cannot Love. <hi>I</hi> anſwer'd theſe obliging words with all the ſweetneſs which her Charms inſpir'd, and if a flame equal to that of hers did not then poſſeſs me, <hi>I</hi> told her, my Gratitude and her Beauty would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt me, and my Heart ſhou'd quickly bid adieu
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:179798:67"/> to its old Miſtreſs, to entertain one whoſe merit juſtly claim'd a better. This eas'd the Maid, and I left her more ſound in mind and better than I found her. <hi>Attabalippa</hi> met me juſt as I came out, and forc'd me with her back into the Room. <hi>Olmechine</hi> bluſh'd at the unexpected Happineſs, and was ſcarce able to look upon her Aunt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her Lover look'd and was ſo nigh. She was glad to ſee her Niece alter'd to the better; and going to the other end of the Room, view'd her ſelf in a large Glaſs, oppoſite to the Bed, and ask'd me, ſmiling, how I lik'd her dreſs? Then told me, how ſuch a one had lov'd her, that a Lord had dy'd for her, and that moſt of the Youth in <hi>Chira</hi> ſtill ſigh'd for her, and wondered where that Beauty lay which charm'd them. I anſwered her dotage very modeſtly, and <hi>Olmechine,</hi> (whoſe Feaver was now abated) took particular notice of all that paſt; was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd of her weakneſs, and ſenſibly touched to find a Rival where ſhe leaſt look'd for one. In the mean time, the old Gentlewoman, who had forgot ſomething below Stairs, quitted the Room, after ſhe had deſir'd me to wait upon her Niece, and divert her melancholy thoughts till ſhe return'd. I look'd upon the fair one, with an Air that ſpoke me pleas'd with the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and imployment; and ſhe, with a Charming Voice, told me, ſhe was not the only Conqueſt I had made; and tho' ſhe fear'd ſome ill Conſequences from her Aunt's paſſion, yet ſhe had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing Age inflam'd, and lookt upon it as ſome excuſe for hers. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd I had been long ſenſible of that eſteem her Aunt had for me, but that it had never met
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:179798:68"/> with any Encouragement; that ſince her Charms had been able to drive <hi>Amazonta</hi> (for ſo I had always call'd you) from my Heart, they were ſufficient guards againſt the fond aſſaults of an old Woman, whom I eſteem'd only, becauſe of that Relation ſhe had to her I lov'd. The fair one, ſighing, anſwer'd all I ſaid with ſo much modeſty, ſhe look'd like innocence her ſelf, and told me, her paſt misfortunes yielded to her preſent Happineſs, that all her loſſes doubly were repay'd, and ſhe no more complain'd of cruel fortune. Her Face and Breeding ſpoke her Quality beyond her preſent Circumſtances; and ſeeing ſhe was able to ſpeak without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to her health, I gently preſs'd ſhe'd let me know who it was had taken the happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour Captive, and if my Love was able to repay the leaſt part of her by paſt Sufferings. She, all goodneſs, and full of love, after a few Tears, began. Here <hi>Adraſtus</hi> ſtopt, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my conſent to the Relation of <hi>Olmechine</hi>'s ſtory; which, Madam, for your divertiſement, I likewiſe ſend you; and if my Letter be of too great length, impute it to my Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and the deſire I have to ſerve you.</p>

His Father (whom Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had bleſs'd with no more Children) griev'd to ſee that Son, from whom his Age had hop'd ſo many Bleſſings, the cauſe of endleſs fears. And to reclaim him from his wildneſs, thought Marriage the beſt expedient. <hi>Almado,</hi> his Friend and Neighbour, (a Man equal to himſelf in Birth and Fortune, the Father of two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) had often propos'd an Alliance with his Family; and of this he now reſolves to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. The Match is immediately agreed upon between them, and my Father Accompanies the old Earl to <hi>Almado</hi>'s Houſe, where he ſaw the Charming <hi>Arathea</hi> (for that was my Mother's name) and ſeeing Lov'd. She, whom Fame had acquainted with his Nature, and her Father with his buſineſs, had that grief upon her Soul the accident might juſtly give. This languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adds to her Beauty, and to his Flame. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mado,</hi> who was of a gen'rous temper, was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſee his Daughter averſe to what he thought conduc'd ſo much to her welfare, and tells her all the Advantages that attend ſo great a match, that the Love my Father had for her wou'd ſettle his roving thoughts, and ſtay his Soul at home. Her Beauty wou'd doubtleſs reclaim him. That Marriage wrought ſuch changes, was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from every day's experience; and that Youth in that ſtate, were oblig'd to reckon themſelves amongſt the number of men, and as ſuch to live; that a lovely Woman had more Eloquence

But this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Scene, was not of long duration; for the Brave <hi>Almado,</hi> had the misfortune, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd by Villains, (Enemies to Virtue) of ſome deſigns againſt his Prince, and was forc'd to ſeek for ſafety in another Nation, where he ſhortly after dy'd. Old <hi>Manco</hi> griev'd for the misfortune of his Friend; but more to ſee his Eldeſt Daughter ill us'd by his own Son, and the other expos'd a prey to Contempt and Poverty, becauſe her Father's Fortune anſwer'd for his ſeeming guilt, and pay'd for Crimes not his. But as if Heaven had deſign'd my Mother for the longeſt ſufferer, the Earl (after he had ſettled a ſmall part of his Eſtate upon her Siſter <hi>Attabalippa)</hi> dy'd, and left the diſconſolate <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rathea,</hi> to mourn a loſs which Fortune ne're attempted to repay.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Manco</hi> ſoon forgot the loſs of a Father, whom he had always look'd upon as an allay to all his Pleaſures; and now being entirely Maſter of himſelf and Fortune, he aims at Vice in all her pomp, keeps an Army of Footmen, plays inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly at Cards with every Sharper, and pays a double price for every pleaſure. While thus he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:179798:69"/> liv'd, I came into the World, and tho', he look'd upon my Mothers Charms and Virtue, as things not worthy of his ſerious thoughts, yet upon this occaſion there was nothing wanting that Money, maſter'd by a laviſh mind, could bring, and the poor Counteſs mourn'd in ſtate, to ſee her Infant born to cruel wants. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after it, he ſold one half of his Fortune, to appeaſe the rageing hunger of ſome gaping Creditors; the remaining part cou'd not long ſupply his Disburſements, and he at laſt reduc'd it all to nothing. My Mother wearied out with this long Scene of miſery, in a ſhort time ſunk beneath the burden of her misfortunes, and ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plung'd into the other World; while I, whom Heav'n preſerv'd to ſport it ſelf withal, was taken care of by her Siſter, upon whom the Earl (as I have already told you) had ſettled a ſmall part of his Eſtate. She was not of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rathea</hi>'s temper, Gallantry ſeem'd the buſineſs of her life, and tho' ſhe was always Virtuous, yet her Conduct ſeldom made her thought ſuch, for innocence it ſelf, is not ſufficient for a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, unleſs ſhe alſo ſtudy to appear ſo; becauſe the World, which only views the outſide of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, ſeldom offers to give its Judgment of things as they really are, but as they ſeem to be. I had reach'd the twelfth Year of my Age, when <hi>Manco</hi> aſham'd of what was paſt, and terrified with the proſpect of future diſgrace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, (the Companions of Poverty by madneſs brought) abandon'd his Houſe and Relations, and threw himſelf naked upon the World, in the quality of one of her beggar'd Sons, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of nothing, but what in time ſhe might
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:179798:70"/> beſtow upon him for tedious Years of toyls, and hated labour. What few friends his poverty had left him, were ſorry for the accident, but none ſtrove to give relief; and upon ſecond thoughts; inwardly rejoyc'd to ſee the poor ſpendthrift gone, tho' they knew not whither. My few Years did not protect me from a due feeling of theſe Misfortunes; and that Beauty, which already began to diſplay it ſelf in my Face, now droopt and languiſh'd e're its day had dawn'd, and darkneſs ſtrugled with the glimm ring Light.</p>
                     <p>My Aunt ſtill made a conſiderable figure in the World, and ſtrove to maintain ſome part of the Grandeur of her Family, upon that ſmall Eſtate <hi>Manco</hi> had given her; and I was by thoſe, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of our Circumſtances, reputed a Woman of no ſmall Fortune. This gave me the trouble of ſome Lovers, amongſt whom were the Lord <hi>Avilon</hi>'s two Sons, men of infinite parts; the Eldeſt was tall, of good Shapes, had an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Air, danc'd well, and ſung to a wonder, but addicted to Anger and Jealouſie, paſſions of ſufficient force to oppreſs a large ſtock of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. The Younger was all good Nature, of a prompt and piercing Wit, Eloquent beyond expreſſion, had the ſoftneſs of a Woman in his Voice, and all the Courage of that mighty Ceature Man in his Soul. I was equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by both, each ſtrove to gain a Heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of their merits, and tho' the youngeſt had a great ſhare in my eſteem, yet neither of them poſſeſs'd my Love. Thus for a while they Courted, the preſent ſtill ſpeaking to the Advanvantage of the abſent, till <hi>Duverr</hi> (for that was the name of the Eldeſt) o'recome by his

                        </gap>ealouſie, quarrel'd with his Brother, (the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <hi>Sevilus)</hi> by whom (after a few thruſts) he was kill'd, in a field adjoyning to our Houſe. The Young unfortunate Conquerour, kiſs'd the wounded Clay wept over him ſome Hours, and then (conſulting his own ſafety) fled. His Father us'd all his intereſt at Court, to obtain a pardon for his only Son; and <hi>Canador</hi> our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Soveraign (all Mercy) grants it ſoon as ask'd. But he never returning, it was uſeleſs, and the afflicted old Man (now concluding both his Children loſt) in a few Years dy'd, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left his Eſtate to the next Heir-Male, if his abſent Son return'd not.</p>
                     <p>I cou'd not longer live in the Country, where I was look'd upon as the cauſe of ſo many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs. My Aunt, whoſe fortune now began to ebb, was perſwaded by neceſſity, and we came to <hi>Chira,</hi> where unknown we have liv'd theſe five Years without a change of Fortune; nor have we yet heard what became of my poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Father, or the young <hi>Sevilus,</hi> now (if alive) Lord <hi>Avilon.</hi> The Court and foreign Trade renders the City very populous, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Families reſide in it unregarded. Thus you ſee Sir, (continued the afflicted Fair) how mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes have purſu'd me from my Infancy, and I have now added ſenſibly to their number, by that weakneſs of which you have found me guilty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Here ſhe ended,</hi> and the ſtory wrought that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which the affliction of the fair Sex does on generous Souls. I was all pity, all tenderneſs, all ſorrow; and each of theſe were ſwallow'd up in Love. I wiſh'd her all the Happineſs the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:179798:71"/> of her Kind e're poſſeſs'd; ſwore my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Love ſhou'd attone for part of her paſt ills, claſp'd her gently in my Arms, laid her all languiſhing to my Breaſt, and whiſper'd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the kind afflicted. She (whom Love had not robb'd of Modeſty (reprov'd me mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the rudeneſs, and ſaid, ſhe fear'd I doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much her Virtue, when I thus preſum'd upon her Love. I anſwer'd this with words that ſufficiently ſpoke it the effect of my paſſion and my grief, for a thought that differ'd ſo much from my real intentions or ſentiments; Madam, (cry'd I) believe me I love, that I think you Virtuous, that I lament your paſt ſufferings, and ſhall be ever yours. The Aunt jealous of her Niece's Charms, made all the diſpatch ſhe cou'd of any affairs that kept her from me, and enter'd juſt as I pronounc'd the laſt words. At firſt ſhe ſtood amaz'd at what ſhe ſaw, but (willing to conceal that concern ſhe had for the diſcovery) turn'd it into Raillery, and ſmiling ask'd her Niece, if ſhe ſtood in need of a Love-Phyſician, to compleat the Cure of her Feaver. <hi>Olmechine</hi> only ſmil'd; and I, who was obliged to anſwer for both the offenders, told <hi>Attabalippa,</hi> that I ſhar'd in her Niece's ſickneſs; that my Heart was naturally tender, that Women's pains (if fair) were all my own; and that I was glad of her arrival, and thereupon ſhow'd a Picture, (done by the beſt Maſter of the World, which I val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu'd at a hundred Guineas.) This, Madam, (ſaid I) the fair <hi>Olmechine</hi> at firſt view admir'd, but when I beg'd ſhe'd accept the ſmall Complement, it was anſwer'd, you better deſerv'd it, and I ſwore it ſhou'd be ever hers. At this you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:179798:71"/> as if kind fortune had ſent you to decide the difference. The old Gentlewoman was pleas'd to find things no worſe, and decided in my favours; while the Charming Niece had Joys equal to hers, in ſeeing how much I fear'd, and what caution I us'd for the concealment of my flame; for Cares are always Natural ſigns of growing love, and our endeavours to hide any thing, a mark of that value put upon it.</p>
                     <p>In a ſhort time the fair one was perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, and <hi>Attabalippa</hi> wou'd often call me an able <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and attribute the cure to my Converſation. But at laſt growing jealous to a degree of madneſs, ſhe deny'd her that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and watch'd her with as many Eyes as <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> e're had open, when he look'd to the Rival Cow, at the command of the jealous Goddeſs. While I was abſent from this fond tender Beauty, my Heart would ſtruggle 'twixt the old and new, recall to view my firſt and latter Vows, ſhow <hi>Olmechine</hi> in all her ſweetneſs, and <hi>Timandra</hi> with her Honour abandon'd for my ſake, then I wou'd immediately be all yours; when with your Rival I lov'd her, when abſent I forgot her; and ſtill as the moving Object fled from my ſight, the flame ſhe had kindled burnt no longer, but ſerv'd to add to that I had for another. The Aunt ſtorm'd and lov'd, ſaw me frequently, and had always the marks of Anger, Jealouſie, and Love evident in her Countenance, and forgot not to tell me, ſhe took notice of that inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fond young Girl had for me, (meaning her Niece) and was ſorry to ſee how much I contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the encreaſe of her paſſion. I deny'd all, and certainly had left <hi>Chira</hi> to be rid of ſo
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:179798:72"/> many tortures, if the Compaſſion I had for <hi>Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mechine</hi>'s ſufferings had not commanded my ſtay. At Night <hi>Curacas</hi> told me ſhe had met him upon the Stairs, and deſir'd to ſee me next Morning at the Rivers ſide. I fail'd not to be there, and had not waited long when ſhe arriv'd. We ſpent the firſt part of our time upon the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; where we diſcours'd our Loves anew, laugh'd at the old Aunt, pity'd her weakneſs, and pleas'd our ſelves with the hopes of coming Happineſs. But the day growing hotter, we forſook the inconſtant Element for one more fix'd, and choſe to walk beneath ſome Trees which grew upon the Bank; <hi>Olmechine</hi> on a ſudden ſtop'd, and offer'd to retire, becauſe the King was upon the place; and I, who had never yet ſeen this Prince, was now reſolv'd to lay hold of the opportunity. But as I was about to tell her ſo, the mighty <hi>Canador</hi> appear'd, of whom Fame ſpeaks ſo many wonders. He diſcours'd familiarly with any Man that approach'd him, look'd all Majeſty and Courage, yet had Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy painted in his Face. We ſtood ſometime to ſee what Courtiers were with him, when to the wonder of all, a young Man (with his Hair cut above his Ears, impriſon'd (you'd thought ſo at leaſt) in his Coat; his ſhoes and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing about him beſpeaking his Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and his Gloves thrown beneath his Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit) approach'd. He ask'd ſome Perſons of Quality which was the King, and having found him, bluntly demanded if he was <hi>Canador</hi> the Soveraign of <hi>Naitrant;</hi> who ſmiling anſwered he was. The Seaman immediately pulls a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of his Pocket, and preſents it with that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:179798:72"/> grace inherent to men of his profeſſion. The King ask'd from whom it came? And he confidently reply'd, from my Companion honeſt <hi>Villacus,</hi> a Man who has done your Majeſty great ſervice at Sea theſe Seven Years paſt. He came on ſhoar ſome Months ago, and after he had ſpent his Money with pleaſure, as with toyl he gain'd it, was forc'd by Neceſſity to reimburſe with the firſt opportunity, and ſo had the misfortune in a Civil way to borrow ſome pounds upon the Road from a Gentleman, for which he is now detain'd Priſoner in the <hi>Caroula,</hi> and may ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pay too much intereſt for the Mony, if your Majeſty does not diſcharge the Sum, and relieve him ſpeedily. The King was pleas'd to open the Letter; which we afterwards underſtood to be to this purpoſe.</p>

After ſome minutes thus ſpent, they at laſt ſeated themſelves and ask'd a thouſand queſtions of each others For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. <hi>Olmechine</hi> preſs'd <hi>Avilon</hi> to tell her if he was the Man who had addreſs'd the King the preceeding day, for a Pardon to his Friend. <hi>Manco</hi> ſmil'd, and deſir'd the Lover to ſatisfie her Curioſity. At this I offer'd to retire, but 'twas beg'd I'd ſtay. In the mean time the Young Lord began, and told her how he had met with her Father at Sea, that they had both ſerv'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one Ship, that a few weeks after they came to <hi>Chira,</hi> they went into the Country to enquire after her, where by the way the Earl was apprehended for a Robbery, becauſe he had ſome reſemblance of the Author, and being Condemn'd, they had made uſe of that Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem to obtain a Pardon, without diſcovering his Quality. That when he had left the King, he waited at the end of the Avenue and dog'd her home; and that as ſoon as her Father was at liberty, and they had provided themſelves in handſome Cloaths, they came to wait upon her.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:179798:74"/> The fair one wept at the ſtory of their hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, thank'd the Gods that had reſtor'd her Parent to her, and kneeling ask'd his Bleſſing. The Earl, with all that gravity in his Face which Age and misfortunes commonly imprint told her that Heav'n had now repay'd all his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that he ſaw the Errors of his Youth, and was ſorry he had been the Cauſe of all her paſt miſeries.

At this ſhe bluſh'd, and the happy young Lover throwing himſelf at her feet, conjur'd her to remember his paſt ſufferings, his continued Conſtancy, and all his Vows.

                     <p>In the Morning ſhe ſent for me, and after a thouſand bluſhes and faint ſighs, ask'd me if I cou'd ſee her Marry'd to another. I lov'd her when preſent, and was ſcarce able to anſwer, but upon ſecond thoughts told her, I cou'd ſee her poſſeſs'd by <hi>Avilon,</hi> becauſe his ſervices beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd her, and that to purchaſe happineſs for her, I cou'd forego my own; I ſhew'd the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Young Lover in his beſt ſhapes, and forgot not to put her in mind of thoſe obligations ſhe lay under to him. She confeſs'd his worth, but doubtcd ſtill the truth of what I ſaid, and ask'd me bluſhing if I ſpoke my thoughts? I ſwore I did; that as Compaſſion firſt begot her Love, ſo it had done mine; and the cauſe once

He was a Man of a great Eſtate but of mean Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, poſſeſs'd every thing that makes an accompliſh'd Gentleman; was a Batchelour, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom given to extravagancy, lov'd Hunting, and fitted the Duke's humour exactly.</p>
                     <p>I had waited but a few hours when <hi>Adraſtus</hi> came; the danger added to the wiſh'd for Bliſs, and I like the conſtant <hi>Hero,</hi> took the bold <hi>Leander</hi> in my Arms, wip'd his cares from him, laugh'd at Honour, and poſſeſs'd my Love. While thus we lay in faſt embraces twin'd, dreamt of no Danger but of preſent Joys; my faithful <hi>Zibelline</hi> came running in, half dead with fear, and almoſt out of breath, Madam, (ſhe cry'd) the Duke! The Duke! Prepare,—now ſave—your Lover—and—your ruin'd Honour.<hi>—Adraſtus</hi> (careleſs of himſelf) ſtarts up, unſheaths his Sword, and points it to his Breaſt. This! This! (ſaid he) ſhall find an entrance here, and pierce my panting, loving,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:179798:79"/> tender Heart, when <hi>I</hi> abandon the too kind <hi>Timandra;</hi> the Duke ſhall bleed, and ſhe ſhall ſtill be ſafe; if now he come this Steel ſhall give him welcom. Trembling <hi>I</hi> caught my Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in my Arms, bid him remember all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Vows; when ſighing at my feet inflam'd he lay, by all our hopes of Happineſs, I ſwore <hi>Minoya</hi>'s death ſhou'd bring <hi>Timandra</hi>'s too. The Lover now no more of Courage knew; his Love for me a thouſand fears begets, and plung'd in grief, all motionleſs he lies, thinking on me, but not my preſent danger. Then on a ſudden leaping from this Trance, he cry'd, Speak! Speak! I'm yours, command me where you pleaſe. <hi>Zibelline</hi> half recover'd from her fright, within my Cloſet hid the hot young Man, my Husband ent'ring juſt as he was gone. My care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs poſture as in bed <hi>I</hi> lay, deludes his fancy with the hopes of Bliſs; and my Maid (who ſaw a fire in his Blood, and how he ſigh'd, and faintly ſpoke my name) retir'd, and left me in his loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Arms. <hi>Adraſtus</hi> heard with ſorrow all that paſt, yet pleas'd to know how faintly <hi>I</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd, each ſigh <hi>I</hi> gave, he thought it meant for him, and all my actions ſpoke the joy unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. So <hi>Proſerpina</hi> when by <hi>Pluto</hi> caught receiv'd the Perſon of the raviſhing God, with all thoſe fears which tender Virgins know, and all the loathings of a lovely Maid, who had been bleſt with better ſweeter loves; but at the laſt, comforts her ſelf with this; that as ſhe was to Hell and <hi>Pluto</hi> ty'd, for half the Year to ſhare unequal pleaſures; the other half was to be ſpent in Heaven.</p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:179798:80"/>
                     <p> When the Duke was gone the Lover ſtraight appear'd, grief preſs'd his Brow, and anger glow'd in his Cheeks. So <hi>Mars,</hi> when taken in another's Bed, ſtorm'd when he ſaw the Gods look laughing on; but more when <hi>Vulcan</hi> ſtood before his Eyes, and <hi>Venus</hi> bluſhing for her Lover lay. My dalliances with the Duke had added to my Beauty, Blood ſparkled in my Face, and the marks of paſt loves ſhin'd in my Eyes. So in the Morning wat'ry Suns appear, and ſpeak that rains were either paſt or coming. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſtus</hi> ſmil'd to ſee the Danger fled, thank'd me, and ſwore he never ſhou'd forget thoſe fears and hazards I had lately known, to give him Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Happineſs in love. Then falling on his knees he kiſs'd my Hand, and ſtole from that low ſtep of Bliſs unto the laſt, we renew'd thoſe Joys we had not finiſh'd, and which my Husband had almoſt loſt us by his ſudden arrival; nor did we part till we had ſufficiently repay'd the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he had done.</p>
                     <p>Some days hereafter, <hi>Adraſtus</hi> told me he had newly come from the Earl of <hi>Rucana,</hi> that he was Jealous of the Duke, becauſe of ſome words he had accidentally let fall, and of his frequent viſits; that he ſwore revenge, and rag'd like <hi>Hercules</hi> in his Poyſon'd Shirt, or the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Bajazet</hi> in his Iron Cage. This gave me a thouſand fears; I knew <hi>Rucana</hi> brave, lov'd much, a Man that wou'd not always be impos'd upon, and had taught the Duke once already what to expect from him. <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſs <hi>I</hi> lov'd <hi>Adraſtus</hi> much, but withal cou'd not chuſe but fear for a man who was my Husband, and who
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:179798:80"/> ſtill doated on me when in my Company, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre all thoſe Charms his new Miſtreſs poſſeſs'd. <hi>I</hi> charg'd <hi>Adraſtus</hi> to run and ſeek him, and prevent (if poſſible) his viſit to the Counteſs that Night. The Lover flew to obey me, and <hi>I</hi> reſted impatient of his ſtay, longing to know the ſucceſs of our project. In the mean time my Husband had gone to <hi>Rucana</hi>'s, where after ſome words had paſt between them, (of which few were Witneſs) they went into the Garden to begin that Tragedy which I ſo much fear'd; for <hi>Minoya,</hi> after he had receiv'd three Wounds, run the Earl thorow the Body, and left him dead upon the place; that done, he leapt over the Garden wall, and coming haſtily thorow the Streets with his Cloak muffled about him, in the dark and without Attendants, he was met by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſtus,</hi> who ſeeing he came from his Brother's ſtept cloſe up to him, and ſuddenly cry'd <hi>Your Grace has been laſt with</hi> Rucana. The Duke terrified with his guilt, dreamt of nothing leſs than his friend; and judging him who ask'd the queſtion privy to what had paſt, drew his Sword, and at the firſt thruſt run him into the Arm. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſtus</hi> ſurpris'd with this return, concluded the Duke had a deſign upon his Life, and in his own defence us'd all the Arts of a good Swordſman, and left my Husband's Soul taking its flight from that paſſage he had given it in his left Breaſt. The noiſe of Swords had drawn a conſiderable number of People together, and ſeveral had ſeen the Duke the firſt aggreſſor, ſo that none offer'd to ſeize him. He came ſtraight to me with his all bloody in his hand, and throwing himſelf at my feet; he fix'd his Eyes upon me, ſet the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:179798:81"/> point to his Breaſt, and cry'd, Here <hi>I</hi> muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my doom for that Crime <hi>I</hi> have unwillingly committed; if <hi>Timandra</hi> acquit me, <hi>I</hi> am able to defend my innocence before the Gods themſelves, but if ſhe do not, then <hi>Adraſtus</hi> falls to appeaſe the angry Ghoſt of his Friend. <hi>I</hi> knew not what to think, the Duke, the Earl run equally in my Mind; his Cloaths and Sword beſprinkled both with Blood, taught me to fear the worſt; and <hi>I</hi> cou'd hardly ſay, ſpeak on, is the Duke my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band well? He all ſorrow ſtarted up, ſtared wildly upon me, and cry'd <hi>Minoya</hi> was no more; at this <hi>I</hi> fainted, and when <hi>I</hi> came to my ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>I</hi> found the lovely Murd'rer at my feet weeping and begging hard for Mercy; he ſhow'd me his innocence, ſwore he wou'd love me to death, tho' extended on the Rack and all his joynts diſſever'd; that if <hi>I</hi> remembred him as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of my Husband's death, he'd own it to the World a baſe treacherous Murder, and throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a Life that was not worth his keeping ſince undervalu'd by me: Then ask'd me if <hi>I</hi> cou'd ſee that Neck ſtretch'd out under the hands of a common Executioner, that I had ſo often em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd in my longing Arms, or his Body hung in Chains like the loath'd Carcaſe of ſome wild Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an or baſe Malefactor, expos'd to contempt, and be the Object of each raskals mirth; conjur'd me to remember all our Joys paſt, his preſent Grief, and conſtant Love. Then raiſing himſelf up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he laid hold of his Sword, curs'd his Stars, his Fortune, and Himſelf; Swore he'd end his Life that moment, pointed it to his Boſom, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:179798:81"/> weakneſs, and faintly murmur'd, can <hi>I</hi> leave <hi>Timandra?</hi> No! No! I cannot, that were to loſe Heaven and Life too. In the mean time the Officers came with a Warrant to apprehend him. I heard the noiſe upon the Stairs, and deſir'd him (but in vain) to provide for his ſafety. When they enter'd he aroſe and told them if they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Man had kill'd <hi>Minoya</hi> he was ready to anſwer for him. Then looking back on me, he ask'd me if he ſhou'd preſerve his Life, or if he was indifferent to me, if the laſt, he knew what to do, for he cou'd ne're reſolve to Live, unleſs <hi>Timandra</hi> Lov'd him, and ſeeing I did not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, come (ſaid he to the Officers) let us go where Juſtice calls for us, 'twixt grief and Love <hi>I</hi> faintly look'd after him, and bid him remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that <hi>I ne're was cruel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When he was gone, <hi>I</hi> began to know ſome reſpite of my ſorrows, and in that ſtate cou'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the nature of the Accident, and my own Circumſtances. <hi>I</hi> remembred the Duke's Love when <hi>I</hi> marry'd him, his good Nature and fond Compliance with every thing <hi>I</hi> deſir'd. Then call'd to view <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> ſaw him my firſt Lover, Conſtant to a wonder, that had conceal'd thoſe favours from the World which <hi>I</hi> had beſtow'd upon him, had kill'd his Friend in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, full of Repentance, but more of Love; deſpiſing his Life for my Love, and ſetting that value upon things, juſt as he found I eſteemed them. Then <hi>I</hi> was all fear for him, I ſaw the Duke's Friends already his Enemies, and knew how Juſtice might be wreſted. But ſtill my cares give place to flattering Hope; <hi>I</hi> remembred we were now both ſingle, that Heaven ſeem'd to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:179798:82"/> have ordain'd us for one another, becauſe of that Sympathy between our Hearts and Natures, and dreamt already of a Heav'n to come; for fear is but the proſpect of a future ill, which pain'd we view and yet might ſhun with eaſe, cauſe when our thoughts on Phantoms are employ'd, Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants are made, which the next moment annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.</p>
                     <p>While thus <hi>I</hi> ſtrove to delude and cozen my ſelf, it was told me the Earl of <hi>Rucana</hi> was found dead in his own Garden, that ſome People had ſeen the Murderer make his eſcape over the Wall, and had purſu'd him ſo cloſe, they ſaw him aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault the Gentleman by whom he was kill'd, and puniſh'd for that Blood he had ſo lately ſhed. <hi>I</hi> was heartily ſorry for the Accident, and equally griev'd the loſs of that good unfortunate Man and his fair Counteſs, who felt double torments, becauſe ſhe knew (tho' innocent) her ſelf the cauſe of this great miſchief. But then to allay my ſorrow, <hi>I</hi> look'd on <hi>Adraſtus</hi> as Earl of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana,</hi> and imagin'd Heav'n had wrought that unlook'd for Happineſs, becauſe it deſign'd to give me joy in full; ſcorn'd a ſcanty Bliſs weigh'd out by Drams and Scruples, and threw upon me what my ambition ſcarce durſt hope for.</p>
                     <p>The Duke's Relations came frequently to ſee me, and to condole with me that loſs, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſecond thoughts <hi>I</hi> ſcarce eſteem'd one. <hi>I</hi> cou'd have wiſh'd them leſs kind, or at leaſt leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal; and 'twas a hard task for me to diſſemble my real thoughts, and feign a ſorrow equal to my loſs. But harder when they preſt me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them if any words or actions proceeded the Duke's death, from which they could infer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:179798:82"/> Murder, and conſtrued all <hi>Adraſtus</hi> e're had done to ſerve their purpoſe; and <hi>I</hi> had it (by ſome of my beſt Friends) privately told me, that they ſuſpected me conſcious to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, becauſe <hi>I</hi> had always ſhown a more than common eſteem for the Murd'rer. This moſt of all afflicted me, not that <hi>I</hi> fear'd any preſent danger from their Malice, but becauſe <hi>I</hi> look'd upon it as an impediment to that Marriage <hi>I</hi> had already promis'd my ſelf with <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered how evidently <hi>I</hi> ruin'd my Honour and Reputation, if <hi>I</hi> took to my Bed the Man who had kill'd my Husband, and whom too many judg'd the wilful Author of his death, to promote and ſecure his own Happineſs.</p>
                     <p>While <hi>I</hi> was thus diſtracted between the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant proſpect of future Happineſs and preſent Cares; <hi>Zibelline</hi> told me that <hi>Curacas</hi> had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Conſequence to impart to me. <hi>I</hi> long'd to know what was become of his Maſter, if he bore his confinement patiently, and if he ſtill lov'd me. The faithful Servant anſwered me with ſighs, and delivered me that Letter which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd all my fears. The words were theſe, if <hi>I</hi> remember.</p>

                     <p>This Letter gave me all the ſorrow imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I had loſt my Husband, and was then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd I ſhou'd loſe my Lover too. I knew part of what the World thought of me, and found I ſhou'd be left to mourn my Misfortunes by my ſelf. My Mother was dead ſeveral Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, and whether ſhe ſuſpected the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my Virtue or not, I am not poſitive, but there wanted not thoſe who ſaid ſhe did, and that it made too deep an impreſſion upon her Heart, and conduc'd to her ſpeedier Journey into the other World.</p>
                     <p>At Night the mourning Lover came, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him with that ſorrow which our mutual Misfortunes had taught me; and he unable to ſpeak, embrac'd my knees, wept, and look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me. Thus for a while we continued dumb, and experienc'd the Truth of that Maxim, that Wounds are deepeſt and moſt dangerous that Bleed inwards. But at laſt this Lethargy which often attends immoderate grief, was by degrees weakned, and the lovely Youth could faintly pronounce theſe words. Can the merciful <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandra</hi> be my Enemy? Can ſhe conſent to my Baniſhment from <hi>Capac?</hi> And ſhall I be bleſt with her preſence but three ſhort days? (for no more have my Judges allow'd me) And muſt the remainder of my Life be ſpent in abſence, a Hell ſufficient for the Puniſhment of Parricide? Nay
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:179798:83"/> broken Vows or inconſtant Love, a Crime yet greater, and known only amongſt Infidels. I ſhar'd all his pains, and after I had ask'd him if he had ſtol'n with privacy enough to my Houſe; I caught him in my Arms, kiſs'd him, and ſpoke all that my tender Heart could dictate to give him eaſe. He ſtill urg'd his Conſtancy and Love, his preſent miſery and proſpect of a greater, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd me to be yet more kind, and ſince he could not permit me to go along with him into a ſtrange Country, beg'd I'd conſent to Marry him and tye my ſelf for ever his: Time, his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and his Friends might have his Sentence repeal'd, and he doubted not if <hi>I</hi> lov'd him now, of being more happy in his own Country, than ever he had yet been. He ſet before me a full Enjoyment of that Heaven in Love which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto we had only taſted; that his Innocence was evident to every Man, whoſe opinion was not prejudicated, that none wou'd condemn me, but thoſe who envy'd my Charms and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that Honour at beſt was but a <hi>Chimera</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to pleaſe giddy fools, and perſwade them into a belief of their own worth, merit, and judgment, e're the pleaſures of Love were fully known; and preach'd up by Women in Years, to keep younger ones from ſharing the Bleſſing. That nothing was more Honourable (if I wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip'd that ſhadow) than a conſtant paſſion. It ſpoke us fix'd in our Choice, and by conſequence of a good Judgment, that enabled us at firſt to make that Choice of which we had never repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That we were born to love, that without it we were meer pieces of moving Earth, dull Phlegmatick lumps, fit only for the Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:179798:84"/> or at leaſt the Company of Brute Beaſts, that it could ne're be known, (meaning my Marriage) that he knew how to value my Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and, that even when old Age ſeiz'd me I would be ſtill the ſame to him; he'd call my firſt Embraces back to view, remember what I then was, and again think me the ſame, for tho' he graſpt me cold and wither'd in his Arms, he'd delude himſelf with the fancy or Idea of my Youth, imagination ſhou'd ſupply what Years had loſt, and I ſhou'd be ſtill the Charming, Gay, the Young, belov'd <hi>Timandra.</hi> In ſhort, Madam, I was again o'recome by this invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lover; and tho' <hi>Minoya</hi> had been buried not above eight weeks, I gave my hand and with it my Heart to this Young graceful Man, tho' not before we had brib'd a jolly Prieſt with a handful of Piſtols to a ſilence equal with that of the Grave, and I had obtain'd my Husband's promiſe not to depart the Kingdom, but to live privately with me till Fortune ſhou'd be as much his friend as Love had been. We ſpent the Night with that pleaſure known only to happy Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; ſome fears and cares we had which ſerv'd to give it taſte, but none ſufficient to deſtroy the Bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>In the Morning he waited upon his Friends, who all ſincerely griev'd his Misfortune, and he ſeemingly prepar'd every thing for his ſudden departure. Three days thus ſpent, he took a ſolemn farewel of them all without ſorrow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in me he found all that made him happy, for the poſſeſſion of thoſe belov'd is at any time a double recompence for the loſs of Liberty.</p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:179798:84"/>
                     <p> It is not, Madam, the cuſtom of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to mourn the loſs of a Husband above a week, and the graveſt Matrons are ſatisfied with the long penance of Fourteen days in Tears. So that I was already Courted by ſeveral who had envy'd the Duke's Happineſs; and that Beauty which prov'd always fatal to my ſelf and others, in a ſhort time got me a new crowd of Adorers, and tho' I was not look'd upon as a Woman nicely Virtuous, yet ſtill my Eyes atton'd for that defect, and the more ſolid part of Mankind judg'd (becauſe I was Young) that a Grave Husband and good advice might reclaim me, and work wonderful changes and effects upon my eaſie Nature. Amongſt the firſt that claim'd my Love <hi>Aſſapan</hi> appear'd, I have already, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, given you the Character of that Man; but ſhall now add that Love had transform'd him, for tho' he was every way a Man truly taking, and one that well deſerv'd a Lady's good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet this paſſion to which he had been moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſtranger, wrought great alterations. For whereas he was formerly addicted to Hunting, Riding, and ſuch Manlike Exerciſes; he became now tender in his Nature, gentle and Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, ſpoke paſſionately, lov'd dancing, Poetry, Romances, and had all the ſoftneſs and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Lover. He griev'd the loſs of his Friend <hi>Minoya,</hi> but had too great an eſteem of me, to believe what ſome People ſpoke of my betraying his Honour or my own.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adraſtus</hi> (who mov'd no farther from me than into the Garden or another Room) knew all that paſt, and was the more happy in his Confinement, when he ſaw others labour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:179798:85"/> what he unknown and with eaſe poſſeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if the Addreſſes of a Gallant ſerve often to reclaim the Heart of an indifferent Husband; much more muſt the real paſſion of another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame a Man that lov'd ſo violently. But For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that was never my Friend, at laſt betray'd the ſecret Lover. For <hi>Aſſapan</hi> (one day as he came to my Houſe) met the happy Man at the Garden Door. They were equally ſurpriz'd and equally griev'd the unluckly encounter. <hi>Adraſtus</hi> however embrac'd him, and told him he had not yet departed <hi>Capac,</hi> becauſe Love had been his Friend, and had till that time protected him. That his Life and Honour were now in his hands, and he dreamt no danger from a Man of <hi>Aſſapan</hi>'s merit. The Earl anſwered with that Diſcretion or Judgment which was natural to him; but withal let him know he had been unkind, in not truſting to his Friendſhip before Neceſſity (not Choice) had taught him ſo to do. <hi>Adraſtus</hi> alledg'd for an excuſe, how much I was concern'd in his Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that it was not Honourable to betray a Lady's ſecrets, eſpecially thoſe of love, without her poſitive command for it; and hop'd he wou'd Pardon a Crime of which love not want of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was the Author. <hi>Aſſapan</hi> ſmil'd, and gave him all thoſe aſſurances of his ſafety which Oaths or words could yield; and after they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd ſome time about the injuſtice of his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, they came to ſee me. I was amaz'd at the unlook'd for Accident, and had almoſt fainted with the ſudden Apprehenſion of my Husband's danger. When <hi>Aſſapan,</hi> who ſaw my fears, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd, and begg'd a thouſand Pardons for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Author of my griefs; Swore he was glad
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:179798:85"/> to ſee his Friend happy, commended my choice, and added, he wou'd not diſturb my happineſs, (tho' he lov'd much) to be Maſter of the World. I return'd him thoſe thanks his kindneſs merited, excus'd my ſelf for not having ſooner acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with my Circumſtances, that it did not ſuit with my modeſty, and that I was not ſorry for his knowledge, becauſe 'twas what my heart wou'd willingly have inform'd him of before. He anſwer'd, that my Honour and his Friends ſafety ſhould be his greateſt Care, that it was not convenient for my intereſt, that he ſhou'd leave off his Suit ſo ſuddenly, becauſe the World had already ſeen him my Lover, that while he continued his addreſſes, none could ſuſpect him conſcious of my real Fortunes, and he would for the future proclaim to all, my vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as hitherto he had done his Love.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> was o'rejoy'd at this Reſolution the more, becauſe I did not think he would have born the Misfortune ſo patiently, or the Affront <hi>I</hi> put upon him with ſo much Moderation. When he was gone, <hi>Adraſtus</hi> (who had diſſembled his real Thoughts) began to let me know his Fears, that he doubted <hi>Aſſapan</hi>'s virtue would not be proof againſt ſo many Charms; that Love and Beauty had often deſtroy'd the moſt ſetled Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and trampled Honour under Foot: that he was a dangerous Friend, and knew the Arts of Love, and all the weakneſs of a Woman's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I found the aim of all this Diſcourſe, and cou'd almoſt have reprov'd him for his fears. But then conſidering his Jealouſie as the Child of Love, I ſmil'd, and embrac'd him, gave him all the Bleſſings mighty Love beſtows, and lull'd his fears aſleep.</p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:179798:86"/>
                     <p> 
                        <hi>Aſſapan</hi> came frequently to ſee me, and I could obſerve nothing in his Words and Actions, that was not quadrant to thoſe Promiſes he had lately made me. But at laſt, prevail'd upon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the heat of his Love, or the hopes of my weakneſs, he made thoſe Addreſſes which did not at all pleaſe me, and ſwore <hi>Adraſtus</hi> was too happy, that he could no longer be my Friend or his, but a Lover to the one, and a conſtant Rival to the other. This cruel and ſudden change gave me inexpreſſible ſorrow, and taught me to fear a thouſand Miſchiefs; then, as an addition to my Affliction, I ſaw it was what I cou'd not ſafely communicate to the lovely Partner of all my Cares, for when mighty pains are in one Boſom found, 'tis over-charg'd and may in time be rent, but having got a breaſt that ſhares the load, they ſtraight take Wing and leave the oppreſſed Heart, the o'reburden'd Soul mounts upwards, joys in its new Liberty, and finds its Weights remov'd.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Earl continued his Viſits, and fail'd not to urge the violence of his flame, in words that never expreſs'd a modeſt Love; and one Day (the moſt unfortunate I er'e had ſeen, or now can know) told me, if I was not marry'd to <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> I was not virtuous, and if I was, it ſpoke me regardleſs of my Honour, if I conſider'd him as the Author of <hi>Minoya</hi>'s death, and remembred what the World thought of me in that Husband's time.</p>
                     <p>You ſee, Madam, how Men are converted by Love into as many different Reſolutions and Humours as <hi>Proteus</hi> e're knew ſhapes; he who a few Days ago was all Love, all Friendſhip
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:179798:86"/> and Tenderneſs, now became ill-natur'd, indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, and unkind. I was about to let him know how much I reſented what he had ſaid, but then I remembred the weight of that ſecret with which my ill Fortune had intruſted him, and with grief and anger painted in my Face, told him, he ſpoke not like the gen'rous <hi>Aſſapan,</hi> for he was my Friend, nor could I believe the words meant to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Minoya,</hi> becauſe I was aſſur'd he once lov'd her, and had a better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of her Virtue. When he ſaw me ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and calm in my Anſwer, <hi>I</hi> fancy he was at firſt ſorry for his indiſcretion; but when men once doubt a Woman's virtue, 'tis impoſſible they ſhould Love, and where there was Love in the beginning Luſt ſupplys its abſence; though her faults have make her too deform'd for a Wife, yet her Beauty ſerves to make her good enough for a Miſtreſs; beſides, thoſe who are known to have yielded to one Man, are often (if not always) by the uncharitable World ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of the ſame weakneſs towards another.</p>
                     <p>Thus it was with the unkind Earl, for (after he had paus'd ſome Minutes) he told me I muſt conſent to his Happineſs, or begin my own Miſery. This ſentence flaſh'd like lightning to my Heart: I remain'd ſilent, anger and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſhar'd my Thoughts, and all my Courage was ſcarce able to ſupport me. He ſaw my Countenance, but miſtook my Paſſion, and from my ſilence drew Conſent, caught me in his Arms, kiſs'd me, and ask'd if I was yet reſolv'd to bleſs him with Enjoyment? All his words were wounds, each of them reach'd my Soul, and I ſtill continued dumb. This he concludes a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:179798:87"/> faint denial, embrac'd me in his Arms again, and when I offer'd to reſiſt, or call for help, he ſwore <hi>Adraſtus</hi> ſhould anſwer for my unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with his Life. Fear made me weak, and the ſudden aſſault bore my Virtue head-long before it. Weeping I lay beneath the treacherous Maſs, and wiſh'd each moment he conſum'd in Joy, might bring whole Years of cruel deadly Pains. The gods look'd on and ſaw <hi>Lucretia</hi> raviſh'd, no wonder then they had no Thunder bolts in ſtore, to relieve one who ſo often had offended.</p>
                     <p>While thus in height of Pleaſure he lay drown'd, remembred what had paſs'd to move a new deſire, rov'd wildly and immodeſtly o're each part to kindle expiring Flames, and ſurfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Joy ſtill ſought for more. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky <hi>Adraſtus</hi> (led by wild Chance, or by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Fate) enter'd the Room to find his lov'd <hi>Timandra. I</hi> ſaw him firſt, but gods you only know what torments ſeiz'd my Mind, and rack'd my guilty Soul! A while he ſtood immovable and gaz'd, then fury enter'd, and his judgment fled, all thoughts of mercy from his nature were excluded; revenge (the darling of his Soul) grew high, and in that frenzy drawing nigh the Bed, with one dire ſtroak (as ſwift and ſudden as if from Heav'n it had come) he ſtab'd the guilty Raviſher to the Heart. Curs'd be the hour (he cry'd) when firſt I lov'd, but doubly that in which I firſt betray'd <hi>Minoya!</hi> Heav'n! juſt Heav'n! has now repay'd that injury I did him. The Earl groan'd, graſp'd at his Sword, and in that Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dy'd. Beſmear'd with Blood all mixt with briny Tears, trembling and fainting from the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:179798:87"/> Bed I roſe, then threw my ſelf half dead upon the Ground, weakly I graſp'd the Murderer's ſhaking Knees, and in my Arms with dying fervour hugg'd them, beg'd as he ſtill had lov'd, he'd now prove kind, and if he thought my Heart had given conſent, he'd tear it panting from my treacherous Breaſt; or if he'd make me Miſtreſs of that Steel, that ſmoak'd with a Letcher's Blood yet hot upon it, my guilty Arms or Limbs that graſp'd the Raviſher, or in the leaſt contributed to the advancement of his Pleaſure, and ſpurr'd his triffling Luſt to greater fiercer Flights, ſhould in a moment be divided from my Body, even that tender Body which he had ſo oft embrac'd, and thrown away as things of dangerous Conſequence to the reſt, now grown infectious baſe and uſeleſs. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd him to remember, how at my Feet he ſighing lay, when juſt return'd from <hi>Chira,</hi> how he had beg'd and lov'd that Night I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him for my Husband, and how for his ſake I had abandon'd Honour, Virtue and my Vows, and all that peace of Mind which inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence beſtows, and thoſe who deviate from the right ne're know. Trembling he held the fatal Dagger up, view'd me with rolling Eyes, and wildly cry'd, Ah Heaven! Muſt ſhe dye, and muſt <hi>Adraſtus</hi> be the Author—No!—Oh <hi>Timandra!</hi> Why wert thou not leſs Fair, or more Virtuous? And I, unhappy I, leſs in Love. This ſaid, he kneel'd and claſp'd me in his Arms, bid me farewel, and remember him no more; then ſtarting up, he exclaim'd againſt Heaven and me, rav'd for ſome Minutes, then again grew calm; bid me again farewel, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:179798:88"/> beg'd I would forgive what he had ſaid; then forc'd the bloody Dagger to his Heart, and fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by me on the Floor expir'd. I ſhriek'd when that ſad ſtroak was given, ſtrove to recal his parting Soul, and ſtop its flight to Heav'n. I pull'd the dreadful inſtrument of Death from that Breaſt, where I had ſo often reſted my wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Arms, when wearied with exceſs of Love, and that ſo often equally ſhar'd my Joys and Cares, kiſs'd his pale Cheeks, and waſh'd them with my Tears. I remembred all his kind Looks, his ſweet Embraces, his moving Words, his Charms, and conſtant Love; and to ſumm up all my griefs in one Word, Adraſtus <hi>was no more, for me he liv'd, and for my Crimes he dy'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt who enter'd the Room were <hi>Zibel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> and <hi>Curacas.</hi> The ſad Object mov'd both their pity and wonder; the faithful Servant em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd the dead Body of his once kind Maſter, and (if he had not been prevented by my Maid) had certainly poſted after him into the other World. This would have added to my grief, if it had been capable of Addition. I told them the whole ſeries of this Tragical Story, and <hi>Aſſapan</hi>'s Body confirm'd the Truth. Then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had long deliberated on what was to be done, and conſider'd the ſhame and hazard that attended my ſtay, I took what Jewels and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney I had, and that very night (attended only by my faithful Maid and the Servant of my departed Husband) I began my Journey, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate beyond my hopes, ſince it made me known to you. I need not, Madam, tell you, how after I had travell'd eight long Days and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:179798:88"/> Nights o're-whelm'd with grief, and ſurrounded with deadly Fears, and having loſt my way, my pitying Stars directed me to your Houſe. Let it ſuffice, that when I left you I went with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any danger beyond Seas, where I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd my ſelf to a Monaſtry, and tho' I am dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblig'd to attend Religious Excerciſes, I have nevertheleſs found a time to give you that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction you deſir'd, and ſhall be glad to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that faithful Journal of your Amours, which you have promis'd to ſend me. I ſhall end with the following Lines I made at Sea in my Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age hither, when I have confeſs'd my ſelf your Debtor for your Couſin the Abbeſs of <hi>M—s</hi> kindneſs to me.</p>

                  <p>THAT Journal you ſent me of your Amours, has confirm'd me your debtor: I grieve your Misfortune, and the death of that conſtant Lover <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> and am ſorry that <hi>Minoya</hi> fell by the hand of a Man he had ſo long honoured and eſteem'd. But to repay part of that Sum I owe, take the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Account, with the Truth of every Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as far as my memory could ſerve me. And as <hi>I</hi> believe you have conceal'd nothing from me, ſo you will find me a very plain dealer in mine, and my order the ſame, in which you deliver'd yours, without the tedious preambles of Birth, Education, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with many other trivial Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which relate not at any time to the ſtory of my Love, or to your Divertiſement, which is my only aim.</p>
                  <p>My Father (the Duke of <hi>Xenſa)</hi> wearied out with the weight of ſeveral Employments, in which he had long officiated, and after ſeveral Services done to his Prince and Friends, at laſt retir'd to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:179798:91"/> his pleaſant Country Seat, ſituated near a calm Sea, but diſtant Seven or Eight days Journey from <hi>Coloa</hi> (the Metropolis of <hi>Fabria)</hi> made rich, by the conſtant Court and Bounty of <hi>Ziphares</hi> the preſent Soveraign. At this time I had reach'd the thirteenth Year of my Age, and you may think perhaps, I was too Young to be ſenſible of that mighty Paſſion, Love. But this I know, that for two Years before my Father had abandon'd the Court, I felt a certain tenderneſs for the Young <hi>Martius;</hi> and if I had not all thoſe little cares and pleaſant pains which riper flames inſpire, I knew nevertheleſs what it was to grieve at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. His Father (the Duke of <hi>Mangroa)</hi> had loſt a Brother (the Count <hi>Torruſco)</hi> by <hi>Xenſa</hi>'s hand, from which an irreconcilable feud had commenc'd between our Families. But Heav'n (that often Blinds and infatuates thoſe whom it deſigns to puniſh) permitted the Children to be poſſeſs'd with thoughts quite different from thoſe of their Parents; for the Charming <hi>Indoretta (Mangroa</hi>'s only Daughter) had already made my Brother a Priſoner to her Beauty. I was too ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of this ſeeming union, and (tho' Young) forbore not to flatter my ſelf with the hopes of coming Happineſs. The Lovely <hi>Martius</hi> fail'd not to contribute to the deceit, and to give me a Charming deſcription of the World, e're my Journey in it was half begun; and ſhow'd me all the ſweets of Love, without its bitter allays. His Siſter ſpoke for him, and by the ſame Priviledge and Example, I recommended <hi>Artaxus</hi> as my Brother, and her Lover.</p>
                  <p>What opportunities we had were ſtole with hazard, conſequently ſhort, and imploy'd to the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:179798:91"/> beſt Advantage. Our Mothers were both privy to what paſt, and equally favour'd our growing paſſions. This was a Heav'n of pleaſure to what I felt, when I ſaw my ſelf confin'd to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Houſe, and all thoſe Bleſſings loſt; I valu'd each moment of the time paſt at a double price, and imagin'd, that whole Years of Converſation wou'd impart the ſame Joys thoſe ſtol'n hours had given. My Brother felt an equal pain, the fair <hi>Indoretta</hi> was the Object of all his thoughts, the Miſtreſs of his Soul, and the end of all his wiſhes. He wou'd often (ſighing) complain of that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, he was forc'd to pay to his Father. Ah <hi>Sirena!</hi> (wou'd he cry) were thy Charms as powerful, as thoſe of the lovely <hi>Indoretta,</hi> the gen'rous <hi>Martius</hi> had e're now follow'd us into the Country, and tho' his Father (ſtubborn as my own) is averſe to any alliance with our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, he had certainly found out a time to ſee us, and I had known what thoughts the Charming Fair had of me. But ſure he loves not! and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets to plead my Cauſe. I had all thoſe pains for the abſence of <hi>Martius</hi> which my Brother expreſs'd, but hid them ſo carefully, that he thought they proceeded only from a ſenſe of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time my Father had other reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he ſtrove ſpeedily to accompliſh. Count <hi>Bonzeda</hi> liv'd in <hi>Mangroa</hi>'s Houſe, which was divided from ours only by our adjoyning Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. And tho' <hi>Xenſa</hi> hated his friend, he had no averſion for him; becauſe he was a Man of a vaſt Eſtate, much in his Princes favour, and had all thoſe Advantages, which in this Age ſerve to recommend a Husband. He had been a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:179798:92"/> Widower five Years, but more remarkable for being the Brother of the Lovely <hi>Manderina.</hi> The Count had ſeen me, and lov'd; my Father (becauſe it ſerv'd his interreſt) was pleas'd to ſee that Paſſion he had for me, and without conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my inclinations, the Match was immediately reſolv'd upon. <hi>Artaxus</hi> (who fear'd nothing more than the loſs of his <hi>Indoretta)</hi> was ſenſibly afflicted at theſe proceedings, and ſaw how far this Marriage wou'd make againſt his intereſt that way. He complain'd of me, and of his Fortune, and us'd all the Arguments that could perſwade a Young Heart (fond of another Man) to diſobedience and hatred. My Father fail'd not to obſerve my indifferency, but miſtaking the Cauſe, attributes all to Modeſty, and flatters me into compliance. I begg'd ſome time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it, and he (without thinking it ſeverity, or oppoſite to my real ſentiments of <hi>Bonzeda)</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd me only fourteen days; and with a ſerious Countenance told me, he expected then an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that ſhould ſpeak me an Obedient Daughter, and if otherwiſe, I might for ever look upon him as my Enemy.</p>
                  <p>I acquainted <hi>Artaxus</hi> with what had paſt, and he (no longer doubting his own misfortune) Swore <hi>Bonzeda</hi> ſhou'd bleed to prevent the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; he ſtill hop'd that <hi>Martius</hi> lov'd me, and believ'd, if once I was Marry'd to another, he ſhou'd loſe all reaſonable pretences to the Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Indoretta.</hi> His grief added ſenſibly to mine, and tho' my fears told me that Young <hi>Mangroa</hi> had forgot me; I endeavour'd nevertheleſs to perſwade <hi>Artaxus</hi> to write to him, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with the ſtate of affairs. He was at
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:179798:92"/> firſt unwilling, becauſe it argu'd weakneſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire an Alliance of this Nature, with a Man that had by his long ſilence ſhown his averſion, (or at leaſt indifferency) but then remembring, that I advis'd him moſtly (as he thought) for his own quiet and ſatisfaction, and that the eſteem I had for <hi>Martius,</hi> was founded upon that relation he had to <hi>Indoretta,</hi> but above all, rememb'ring the Charms of that Fair one, he was at laſt o'recome, and ſent him a Letter to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

                  <p>The Letter was ſent to a Friend of my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's at <hi>Coloa,</hi> and we numbred the Minutes of each day, in expectation of an Anſwer, and to our grief, ſaw the end of thoſe preſcrib'd me; but no return from this abſent Youth. My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was all rage, mutter'd Revenge againſt <hi>Martius,</hi> and Swore the affront ſhou'd never be forgot.</p>
                  <p>In the Evening, the Duke (accompany'd by <hi>Bonzeda)</hi> came to my Chamber, and ask'd how
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:179798:93"/> I had entertain'd that propoſition he had made me, and if I was diſpos'd to ſhow my Obedience, by my ready conſent to the Count's Happineſs? I bluſh'd and trembl'd at the unwelcome ſound; yet even then <hi>I</hi> had all that averſion for <hi>Martius,</hi> which love neglected could inſpire; I imputed all my preſent torments to his infidelity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs, and was even ready to pronounce his Name, ſo much he poſſeſs'd my Soul, when <hi>Xen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> (who from Silence argu'd the inſtability of my mind, and concluding it convenient to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply mild Arguments to my ſtagg'ring reſolutions) in kind words, ſet before me the Advantages that attended this Match, the Count's Love, and every thing that might prevail with a Woman of my Years. Then ſeeing me ſtill ſilent, come (ſaid he, and taking <hi>Bonzeda</hi> by the hand,) we muſt not expect too much from a Young maid; Silence is a Woman's beſt Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, and their eyes ought to expreſs the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Hearts, eſpecially in affairs of Love. My Daughter (no doubt) knows what value to ſet upon your merit, and has ſufficiently weigh'd my Commands, a few days ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat your Happineſs, and in the mean time leave the Burden of the management to my Strength. This ſaid, he left me, and <hi>I</hi> cou'd ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Count well pleas'd with my ſeeming modeſty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Artaxus</hi> enter'd as ſoon as they were gone, and I (drown'd in Tears) told him my liberty wou'd ſhortly be no more; and I was doom'd a Victim to my Father's Ambition, or miſtaken judgment. He ſigh'd, and faintly ſaid, Oh unkind <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us!</hi> Oh my Divine <hi>Indoretta!</hi> Wou'd to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:179798:93"/> I cou'd love thee leſs—yet thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'ſt greater ſervices than I am able to pay thee, tho' for thy ſake I parted with my life. We complain'd of Fortune, of our Stars, and ſpoke every thing, grief, love, and anger could inſpire. I wiſh'd for the happineſs of ſeeing <hi>Martius</hi> once more languiſh at my feet, that I might have the power of Revenging that injury he had done me. And <hi>Artaxus</hi> ſwore he'd ride Poſt to <hi>Coloa,</hi> that with his Sword he might teach him to remember him.</p>
                  <p>While thus in pain we conſum'd the tedious hours, my Mother enter'd. She diſcover'd in our Faces too many ſigns of our inward thoughts, and (after ſhe had kindly chid us for concealing our Cares from her) offer'd all ſhe thought might give us ſome relief. <hi>Artaxus</hi> threw himſelf at her feet, and conjur'd her to have pity on his weakneſs, and to remember, that Love he had for the Fair <hi>Indoretta</hi> before he left <hi>Coloa;</hi> that it was what he could not o'recome, to loſe her was to be eternally miſerable, and that to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all that miſchief which threatned deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Love, nothing was more expedient, than to put a ſtop to my Marriage with Count <hi>Bonzeda.</hi> The tender Mother was ſenſibly griev'd for the pains of her Children; ſhe knew the Duke's humor, and how little power ſhe had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, but willing to contribute all ſhe cou'd to our happineſs, ſhe bid us rely upon her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and in the mean time not to be diſtracted, with a confus'd proſpect of what was to come, for that was to weave a long and tedious Web of Cares, which one thought, or kind word, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to unravel, and we wou'd afterwards laugh
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:179798:94"/> at thoſe Bug-bears our fears had made. Her words obtain'd that end for which they were deſign'd; and we enjoy'd that peace of Mind, which much hope in midſt of danger can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow.</p>
                  <p>Night had her Curtains half aſunder drawn, and that faint light appear'd, which ſpeaks the coming of the welcome day. The longing Birds were flutt'ring from their Neſts, and labourers weary with their former toyls, began to think of others now at hand. When <hi>Artaxus</hi> (whom Love had robb'd of ſleep) ſent to me, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me, that he deſign'd for <hi>Zenitha,</hi> (a ſmall Village three Miles from our Houſe) and therefore deſir'd me not to expect his Company till Night. He often went to this pleaſant little Town, and the Duke (though bred a Courtier) had that regard to Religion, which men wiſe and honeſt (without Biggotry) ought to have, and told him, he ſhou'd be glad to ſee him often purſue the ſame road, becauſe in the morning I might hear a Maſs or two, and in the Afternoon ſpend ſome hours in Converſation with the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs, who was his particular Acquaintance, and a Woman that deſerv'd that imployment (or Poſt) in the Church, to which his friendſhip had advanc'd her. Madam, that I may give you the ſtory in that Order in which 'twas acted, permit me to tell you what happen'd to <hi>Artaxus</hi> before he return'd.</p>
                  <p>When he had drove about half way, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into a pleaſant Wood upon a River's ſide; it was yet early day, and the Dew lay ſhining on the moſſy Banks. No noiſe was to be heard, but that of a gentle Wind which ruffled 'mongſt the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:179798:94"/> Leaves, and play'd with every tender yielding Bough; the place (you'd thought) for happy Lovers made, and ſo much ſweetneſs Charm'd each ſenſe, 'twas of force enough to inſpire thoſe with a certain deſire, who had ne're been ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a flame, and made them wiſh for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which they wou'd poſſeſs; even when they ſcarce knew what it was they wanted.</p>
                  <p>My Brother having ſeated himſelf, (after he had forbidden his Servants to enter the Wood) began the faint remembrance of his paſt Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and then form'd a lively Idea of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miſeries. He complain'd of Young <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groa,</hi> and ſigh'd for the Charming <hi>Indoretta.</hi> That Silence which reign'd in the place, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to his melancholy, and every Shade which was within his view ſerv'd for ſo many Charms to inflame and heighten Love. While thus he ſat and mourn'd his cruel deſtiny, begging of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a quick relief, and making Vows unto the Gods, as if on Love all happineſs depended. He heard a faint groan which ſeem'd but a few pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from him. This accident ſurpriz'd him, but more when he perceiv'd at the Root of a rugged old Oak (which extended its Arms to welcome the noble gueſt) a Man nobly dreſt and aſleep. His Curioſity tempted him to ſtay, and having poſted himſelf behind an oppoſite Tree, he had not waited long before the ſtranger awak'd, who (after a few deep ſighs) with a Voice that Charm'd the very Heavens, and ſet the Gods a liſt'ning, ſung to himſelf the following Lines.</p>

                  <p>'Tis impoſſible, Madam, to expreſs my Brother's thoughts upon this occaſion; but having conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them ſince, from that account he gave me, I find joy was the o'reruling Paſſion; for a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den faintneſs ſeiz'd him, and he could have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd immoveable upon the place, if he had not perceiv'd his long-wiſh'd-for Friend (who yet had not ſeen him) about to depart.

But that the Brother of <hi>Sirena</hi> ſhou'd not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing which he would not obey; he thereupon began as followeth.

The Duke obſerv'd my melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and often ask'd the Cauſe; but ſeeing no hopes of diſcovering on't that way, he complain'd to a Young Lady who was always with my Siſter. She was a Woman of a piercing Wit, violent in her Inclinations, given to Jealouſie, and would ſtick at nothing, (how dangerous ſoever) if it conduc'd to her pleaſure, or in the leaſt ſerv'd her ambition. But to attone for theſe faults, ſhe was Beautiful to a wonder, could diſſemble to a miracle, and had all thoſe Arts the moſt ſubtle of her Sex e're knew; add to theſe ſeeming Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, Quality, and a vaſt Fortune; for ſhe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:179798:96"/> was the Earl of <hi>Sirama</hi>'s only Daughter, who dying in her infancy, had left her an Eſtate ſufficient to ſupport her Rank in the World, e're ſhe was oblig'd to't.</p>

                        <hi>Ericis</hi> (for that was the Lady's Name) was glad of this opportunity, and fail'd not to let my Father know (for <hi>Indoretta</hi>'s confidence in her ſeeming Friendſhip, had made her Miſtreſs of the ſecret) what otherwiſe <hi>I</hi> had eternally kept from him. This ſenſibly diſpleas'd him, and having found me in the Garden, (after he had by his looks taught me what to fear) <hi>Martius</hi> (ſaid he) muſt my Enemy ſtill Triumph over me? Have I no other to betray me but my own Son? And muſt the Author of <hi>Turruſco</hi>'s death, ruin the Honour of his Brother? No, Young Man! Yours nor your Siſter's madneſs has not yet infected the Father, and the Event of a few days ſhall let you know, how far your Love is inconſiſtent with your Reaſon and Intereſt. This ſaid, he left me in that amazement the unlook'd-for diſcovery juſtly gave. I ſuſpected the weakneſs of <hi>Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta</hi>'s tender Nature, and judg'd he had by threatnings drawn this confeſſion from her. But as <hi>I</hi> was about to conclude her guilty, ſhe enter'd the Arbour where the Duke had left me. Tears trickled from her Eyes, her Beauties languiſh'd, and the lovely kind <hi>Caliſto</hi> felt not half her pains, nor bluſh'd ſo much, tho' when in Streams a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the happier Nymphs, ſhe bath'd and wanton'd 'till her fault was known. I ſoon gueſt the cauſe, and told her how far I had ſhar'd in all her Misfortunes, and was not wanting in my part of this. Ah! Brother (cry'd ſhe) can you forgive me? 'Twas <hi>I</hi> betray'd the ſecret, in truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:179798:96"/> to the perfidious <hi>Ericis,</hi> ſhe alone knew it, and 'tis ſhe only that has ruin'd us. My grief for the accident, had not baniſh'd my pity from an affectionate Siſter; to eaſe her therefore, <hi>I</hi> conceal'd a great part of my pain, and perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to have the ſame eſteem in appearance for the Young Counteſs of <hi>Sirama,</hi> ſhe had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhown in earneſt.</p>
                     <p>Some days after, the Duke told me he had conſider'd my weakneſs, and was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to provide for me a Wife, that (tho' Young) was acquainted with the World, and would ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to preſerve the Honour of his Family, which <hi>I</hi> had ſo evidently endanger'd, by a paſſion of which none but Madmen would be guilty. This diſcourſe almoſt o'return'd my Obedience; and <hi>I</hi> was ready to return him an anſwer, that had ſpoke the leſſening of my Duty, when he (who already perceiv'd the effect it had wrought) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd me the liberty, and on a ſudden cry'd; Son remember who lays this Command upon you, that in the Afternoon you wait upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Sirama,</hi> look upon her as the Woman <hi>I</hi> have deſign'd for my Daughter, her Fortune ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds your Merit, and conſider <hi>I</hi> have mine at my diſpoſal. This moſt ſenſibly afflicted me; ſhe was the Woman who had begun my miſery, and whom <hi>I</hi> now ſaw deſtin'd to prolong the Scene. The Dutcheſs remain'd paſſive in the affair, and griev'd nothing more than the affliction of her Daughter, who yet believ'd her <hi>Artaxus</hi> innocent, and lov'd as much as Virtue could allow.</p>
                     <p>In the Evening <hi>I</hi> waited upon my new Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, who (tho' ſhe was perfectly skill'd in the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:179798:97"/> Art of diſſimulation) receiv'd me with that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, which diſcover'd it ſelf in moſt of her Actions. After ſome diſcourſe in which Love had the leaſt ſhare, ſhe (with a ſeeming and feign'd tenderneſs) told me, ſhe had ſeen the Duke very much out of humour for ſome days paſt, that ſhe was ſorry for his miſtake, becauſe ſhe was perſwaded <hi>I</hi> had never entertain'd any thoughts for <hi>Xenſa</hi>'s Daughter; who beſides her Father's hatred to our Family, had departed from <hi>Coloa</hi> too Young to be ſenſible of any ſuch flame; that ſhe hear'd ſome days ago that ſhe was Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Count <hi>Bonzeda,</hi> and the Young Duke was paſſionately in Love with his Siſter the fair <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derina.</hi> Tho' <hi>I</hi> ſuſpected the Author of Malice, yet the ſtory carry'd ſo much of a ſeeming truth and probability in it, <hi>I</hi> was unable for ſome time to anſwer. But at laſt recollecting my ſelf, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, (ſaid <hi>I)</hi> you hold a Correſpondence it ſeems with <hi>Mangroa</hi>'s Daughter; for <hi>Bonzeda</hi> (tho' my Relation) has not yet acquainted me with as much. However I'm glad to hear of his prudent Choice, and that <hi>Artaxus</hi> weighs his own intereſt and his Father's Commands; for <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſs <hi>I</hi> harbour not one thought for that Family, which is not exactly correſpondent to the height of Friendſhip. The diſſembling Fair ſeem'd ſatisfied with the Truth of what I ſaid, and we parted for that time, <hi>I</hi> full of grief, and ſhe of hopes.</p>
                     <p>At night <hi>I</hi> felt all thoſe pains unhappy Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers know, <hi>I</hi> griev'd my Fathers ill nature, but more the loſs of <hi>Sirena; I</hi> look'd on <hi>Artaxus</hi> as a Man unjuſt and no more my Friend, and tho' <hi>I</hi> did not firmly believe all that <hi>Ericis</hi> had told
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:179798:97"/> me, yet it gave ſufficient ground for doubts and fears to grow upon; and to doubt the loſs of what we Love, brings more of Torment, than a real privation of all we poſſeſs beſides. To this <hi>I</hi> added, that <hi>Bonzeda</hi> had conceal'd his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs from me by <hi>Mangroa</hi>'s order. In the Morning <hi>I</hi> ſaw <hi>Indoretta,</hi> but as yet conceal'd from her my new griefs, and reſolv'd to compleat my ruine, or begin my better Fortune, by a ſure knowledge of what had paſt. <hi>I</hi> Writ to you (my dear Friend) a Letter, the words of which <hi>I</hi> ſtill remember.</p>

                     <p>Juſt as <hi>I</hi> had Writ it <hi>Furinus</hi> enter'd, <hi>I</hi> need not tell you, my dear <hi>Artaxus,</hi> the eſteem <hi>I</hi> had for this Young Man, let it ſuffice, that he poſſeſs'd that place in my Friendſhip, which was next to that <hi>I</hi> always kept for the Brother of <hi>Sirena;</hi> and tho' he was ſomething related to <hi>Ericis,</hi> and high in her favour, <hi>I</hi> had nevertheleſs all that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:179798:98"/> in him which I then Judg'd his merit claim'd as due. He ſoon perceiv'd that Grief under which I labour'd, and offer'd all thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies I could expect from the beſt of Friends. 'Tis natural to all men oppreſt with grief and ſorrow, to communicate their pains to others, either becauſe the burden ſeems divided when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother feels a part, or elſe becauſe we are ready (like ſinking Mariners) to hope for ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and graſp at any thing that firſt preſents it ſelf, without examining if it can contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute any thing to our eaſe or ſafety. Thus I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded my ſelf; and the Young Man (when I had told him all) with a ſeeming kindneſs, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to convey my Letter to a truſty Friend of his at <hi>Zenitha;</hi> who would undoubtedly put it into your hands, with that ſecreſie and conduct which the affair requir'd. I was heartily pleas'd with the opportunity, not knowing whom to truſt, and after I had conjur'd him to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how much my Happineſs depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what he had undertaken for me, we parted.</p>
                     <p>A few hours after, the Duke ſent his Page to acquaint me, that the Young Counteſs was with my Siſter. I knew the weight of that Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, ſaw it impoſſible to ſhun her Company, without a manifeſt token of diſobedience; and went into the Room with all thoſe pains which <hi>Dedalus</hi> e're knew, when through the Air he boldly took his way, and ſaw the Object of his hopes behind, unwing'd and ſinking, and all the pleaſures of a dear bought Liberty, daſh'd by the abſence of his better part.<hi>—Indoretta</hi> (who knew how much my Nature was averſe to this diſſembling Fair) ſtrove to give me all that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:179798:98"/> eaſe which was within her Power, and forgot not to entertain my unwelcome Miſtreſs with a thouſand little indifferent Stories, to divert that neceſſity which had otherwiſe fal'n upon me, of entertaining her with another Subject, to which I had no inclination. <hi>Ericis</hi> fretted much at my Siſter's ſeeming kindneſs, and could have been ſatisfied with half that care ſhe ſhow'd to pleaſe her. She often fix'd her Eyes on mine, and wou'd, with a ſmile (mixt with Jealouſie and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) frequently tell me <hi>I</hi> was a conſtant Lover, or a Man altogether inſenſible of a tender flame, and that perhaps I mourn'd a loſs which might with eaſe be repay'd. I anſwer'd coldly to what ſhe ſaid, and often let her know by my looks, that all ſhe ſpoke was unwelcome. This vex'd her to the Heart, ſhe knew her ſelf handſom, of a ſufficient Fortune, and was Diſtracted when ſhe ſaw her Charms neglected by a Man, for whom ſhe had us'd ſo many Arts to pleaſe, and I found by the Duke's frowns next day, how far ſhe had reſented my indifferency.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>I</hi> liv'd for ſome time, felt a preſent pain, and had but a very confus'd proſpect of a kinder Fortune.

                     <p>'Tis impoſſible, my Friend, to expreſs all thoſe different Paſſions which poſſeſt me, when I read this counterfeited Mark of your ſudden Change. I thankt <hi>Furinus</hi> (who was ſeemingly ſorrowful for me) and own'd my ſelf his Debtor for that care he had ſhown; ſwore <hi>Sirena</hi> ſhould poſſeſs my Heart no more, that it had been too long a Slave to that falſe Fair One, who had ſo ſoon forgot my Services, and whole Years of Love; and that <hi>Artaxus</hi> ſhould bleed, and with his Life attone for his fault.</p>
                     <p>I acquainted <hi>Indoretta</hi> with the Misfortune, and ſhe bore it with that patience which becomes a Virgin Love. However I had not fail'd to acquaint you how ſenſible I was of the injury you had done me, and had at leaſt been ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how I became treacherous to a Man I had eſteem'd ſo much, if a ſudden Feaver had not put a ſtop to my Reſolution, and prevented my intended Journey. <hi>Mangroa</hi> (tho' fix'd in the purſuit of any thing he had once begun) was nevertheleſs affrighted with my Danger, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt repented the unkindneſs done me. But my diſtemper at laſt encreaſing, he (now full of Fears) ſeated himſelf upon my Bed's ſide, and (like a tender Miſtreſs weeping o're her wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lover) confeſs'd his Cruelty, and begg'd my Pardon, with a thouſand Aſſurances, that (if kind Heav'n reſtor'd me to my health) <hi>Sirena</hi> ſhou'd be mine. He'd humble himſelf even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:179798:99"/> his Nature, and beg for Friendſhip from the Man he hated; that former quarrels now ſhou'd be no more, and all his intereſt ſhou'd yield to my future happineſs, than which he knew not a greater. The Brother's unkind Letter had rais'd my Anger, and mov'd my ſleeping Griefs, but had not weakned or deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Love, and the fair Siſter ſtill poſſeſt my heart; for when moſt I ſtrove to raze her from my Soul, the all-conquering Maid with double force return'd; wonder not then if this reſtor'd my health, for hope from Love can never be divided, and <hi>Indoretta</hi>'s Tears kept back my Soul, when on the Wing and eager for its Flight.</p>
                     <p>When I was recover'd, a new Misfortune befel me; for <hi>Mangroa</hi> ſuddenly loſt the beſt of Wives, and I the kindeſt Mother Nature e're had made; my Siſter had all that ſorrow e're poſſeſt a tender loving Daughter, who griev'd the death of a kind Parent, and the Counteſs of <hi>Sirama</hi> was the only Perſon that rejoyc'd; for in her ſhe loſt an Enemy, and one who had favour'd my Paſſion for the lovely Daughter of cruel <hi>Xenſa,</hi> her Rival in all her Virtues, and one who notwithſtanding of her abſence and ſeeming Cruelty, was dearer to me than health to thoſe who ſuffer deadly Pains, a calm to Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men wearied with the Winds, to Travellers reſt, or Men condemn'd Reprieves. Had <hi>Paris</hi> lov'd his <hi>Helena</hi> ſo well, or had ſhe been but half ſo ſweet, ſo good, as bleſt <hi>Sirena</hi> to my view appear'd, a thouſand Years of Famine and of War, Ripes, Butcheries, continued Scenes of Blood, with the Deſtruction of his Houſe and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:179798:100"/> Country, had prov'd a price too low for ſo much Beauty. The gods themſelves had fought for hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <hi>Troy,</hi> and the young Man ſucceſsful prov'd in Arms, old <hi>Priam</hi>'s Seat immoveable had been, his Houſhold gods and Children had been ſafe, and <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had return'd with loſs. Thoſe hopes the Duke had given me, were as ſo many Arrows from the God of Love, and Grief (a mighty paſſion in it ſelf) ſerv'd now to raiſe a greater in my Breaſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ericis</hi> came frequently to ſee my Siſter, and tho' <hi>Mangroa</hi> ſeem'd inclinable to favour that Paſſion I had for the Daughter of his Enemy, yet he had not fully laid aſide his firſt Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and judging that a preſent Beauty, and long abſence wou'd work my Cure, he made uſe of gentle Remedies, and told me it was not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſo ſoon to abandon a Lady's ſervice, after I had confeſs'd her my Miſtreſs; that it was convenient I ſhou'd often wait upon her, leſt <hi>Xenſa</hi> or his Friends might apprehend the cauſe of this ſudden alteration in his humour, and think his friendſhip the effect of Neceſſity not Choice. Where the power of being Active or Paſſive is left to our ſelves, how far ſo ever the thing be oppoſite to our Inclinations, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it with eaſe and ſome pleaſure; and this proceeds from that averſion we have to reſtraint, and our Love of liberty; for we are all born Free, and have a right to all things, and not to continue in this State, is a privation of our own Strength, and argues our weakneſs in not being able to ſurmount, or remove that difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or impediment, which denies or bars us from Enlargement. Beſides we naturally have ſome
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:179798:100"/> reſpect for thoſe who contribute to the ſucceſs of our Love, tho' they did it without deſign, or with an intention wholly to deſtroy it. Think it not ſtrange then that I could now look upon <hi>Ericis,</hi> with an air much differing from that ſhe had formerly ſeen. The falſe Fair ſeem'd pleas'd with this change, and concludes the anſwer of my Letter had wrought it; and fail'd not to acquaint the Duke how much I obey'd, who every Day by his looks confeſs'd his Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Theſe I took for ſo many natural Signs of his kindneſs, and failed not to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my ſelf, ſo far as to believe he wou'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get nothing, that might advance that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip he deſign'd with <hi>Xenſa;</hi> and as 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Love where there is no hope, it followeth that to hope much is to feed the Flame, and make it rage to more unruly Fires.</p>
                     <p>Things were thus, when a Happineſs I ne're had hop'd befel me; for one Night as I came from a Ball at Court, (where my Friends had detain'd me too long) I ſaw at a ſmall diſtance (by the help of his Flambeaux's) the rambling <hi>Fernanthus</hi> Duke of <hi>Meroa.</hi> I knew his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and (not reſolv'd to turn Scowrer that Night) endeavour'd to avoid him, and therefore ſoftly plac'd my ſelf, at the firſt door which offer'd; but as I began to reſt upon it I found it fled, and gave me acceſs to the Houſe unlook'd for. I was at firſt ſurpris'd, but more when I heard a Woman, in a low Voice, cry, Sir, Sir, are you come? I preſently recollected my ſelf, and anſwer'd <hi>Yes,</hi> e're ſhe had fully pronounc'd her laſt Words. She took me by the Hand, and (without any Lights) led into a Room, where
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:179798:101"/> another leaping from the Bed caught me in her Arms, and cry'd, <hi>Ah my dear Youth! Why have you ſtaid ſo long? Know you not how much theſe unkind delays ſhorten the Scenes of Love, and Day appears e're you have trod the Stage?</hi> I made no reply, but ſeem'd impatient of the coming Heav'n, half naked on the downy Bed ſhe lay, her Arms expanded ready to receive me, breath'd ſhort and ſigh'd, then ask'd me why I ſtaid, and by a rapture known to burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Youth, anticipated what ſhou'd be jointly ſhar'd, and give to both an equal part of Heav'n. I ſoon undreſs'd, and kiſs'd the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing She, ran o're the Field of Love with eager tranſports, melted with ſudden Pleaſures and too much of Bliſs, and languiſh'd e're my Joys were half begun. The kind one ſmil'd, and ſigh'd at what was paſt, and us'd thoſe ways which kindle or excite to a new Love the drowſie fainting Soul. She caught my trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Body in her Arms, kiſs'd me, and ſaid, Can you be kind no more, has too much Love deſtroy'd our mutual Bliſs, and has <hi>Furinus</hi> no more Joys in ſtore? Thus wou'd young <hi>Martius</hi> with <hi>Sirena</hi> done, the ſudden leap to happineſs had drown'd his Soul in Extaſie, and made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire weak. But thoſe to whom long practice gives the art of taming by degrees unruly Flames, ſhould know the way to better, longer Loves—Yet ſtay, my Dear, (added ſhe in another tone) what effects will that counterfeited anſwer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, does he forget <hi>Sirena</hi> now? And does the Counteſs of <hi>Sirama</hi> triumph o're that ſucceſsful Beauty? Her immodeſty had mov'd my wonder, but theſe laſt words ſurpris'd beyond belief; and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:179798:101"/>
'twas no longer in my choice to doubt whom it was I had embrac'd, and to prevent that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very which a longer Diſcourſe had certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, I renew'd thoſe Joys for which ſhe long'd, and by my Love ſupply'd the want of Words. While thus we dallied, and height of Pleaſure fill'd the Fair Ones Soul, I ſtole a Ring, and for it left my own. Then leaping from the Bed (with a Voice much differing from that of <hi>Martius)</hi> I bid the Maid farewel, and tho' ſhe knew not whom ſhe then had bleſt, I left her nevertheleſs ſatisfied, that ſhe had beſtow'd her Favours upon a Man, for whom ſhe had not meant them. Her Woman, who waited upon the Stairs, knew nothing of the matter, and with ſoft ſteps taught me the way, whiſpering in my Ear that I had not ſtaid my uſual hour, yet hop'd I I was in health; as ſhe open'd the Street Door, a Man muffled in his Cloak ruſh'd in, caught <hi>Pandora</hi> in his Arms, (for that was the Maid's name) and cry'd, Is thy Miſtreſs well? Why was the Door no ſooner open'd to an impatient Lover? The Wench, without any ſurpriſe ask'd him what he meant, and aſſur'd him he had miſtaken the Houſe, adding, her Miſtreſs was a Perſon of Quality, knew him not, nor would ſhe be diſturb'd at an hour ſo unſeaſonable. Ha, (reply'd he with a louder Voice) is <hi>Furinus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready forgot, and is it for this, I have betray'd young <hi>Mangroa?</hi> At this I ſuddenly leapt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and drawing my Sword, Know Sir, (ſaid I) <hi>Martius</hi> has a Friend ſhall puniſh this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. He (without any reply) retir'd into the Streets, I follow'd, and after a few thurſts had paſt between us, his perfidious Soul at laſt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:179798:102"/> ow'd its paſſage to my Sword, and left his body motionleſs behind.</p>
                     <p>When I came home, the Duke was gone to Bed, and none were witneſſes of my long ſtay, but thoſe of my own Servants who waited for me. 'Tis impoſſible to expreſs thoſe Joys this Night brought me. I ſaw <hi>Artaxus</hi> ſtill my Friend, was perſwaded <hi>Sirena</hi> had not then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got me, and doubted not but that the anſwer of my Letter was forg'd by <hi>Ericis,</hi> with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of that young Man whom I had now puniſh'd for his Perfidy.</p>
                     <p>In the morning the Fair One came to ſee my Siſter, and I was ſurpris'd to find in her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, not one ſign of grief or inward Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances. The Duke ſoon after enter'd the Room, and I was oblig'd to a greater Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance than any I had yet ſhown; ſhe was hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleas'd with my looks, and if ſhe had any real Torment for the loſs of her Lover, ſhe let me know by her Behaviour, ſhe enjoy'd a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that o're-rul'd her Griefs, and hopes of poſſeſſing a new Lover of greater Quality, and (as ſhe thought) Maſter of more Charms, was able to attone for the death of one, whom fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Loves had rendred ſtale and homely to the view. But that which moſt ſhe fear'd was, that he who had ſupply'd his place was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of her Quality, and might diſcloſe the ſecret, for the loſs of her Ring could not be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily digeſted. But this trouble alſo fled, and the preſent appearance of better Fortune, (like the Sun-ſhine of a new Day) diſpell'd from her thoughts, the remembrance of that Storm and Horrour which had rag'd the preceeding Night.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:179798:102"/> In the mean time, credit this ſudden Change in my Fortune which followeth.</p>
                     <p>My Father (now a Widower) began to to entertain ſome thoughts, to which he had been long a ſtranger, and eas'd me of my feign'd Courtſhip, by the reality of his own; he forgets to bid me wait upon <hi>Ericis,</hi> attones for my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency by a paſſion truly violent, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd all thoſe little Arts, which are inſeparable Companions of growing Love. I obſerv'd this Change, but conceal'd my knowledge from him as much as poſſible, and the kind <hi>Indoretta</hi> who was pleas'd with the fidelity of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> and his continu'd Friendſhip to me, upon which ſhe knew the ſucceſs of my Love depended, thankt Heav'n, and her kind Stars, for this new addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my Happineſs. The Counteſs, in whom ambition was always prevalent, wanted only to be a Dutcheſs; and tho' ſhe ſaw no hopes of ſeeing her Son a Duke, (if Heav'n ſhould ſend her one) yet ſhe was pleas'd with her Fortune, when ſhe conſider'd, ſhe might cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly poſſeſs the Father, and had only hop'd (and it may be upon ſmall grounds) the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Son. Thus we liv'd all happy, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each Day might bring us ſome advancement in Fortune's Favour; I never prais'd the lovely <hi>Sirena,</hi> but when I found <hi>Mangroa</hi> pleas'd with the ſubject; nor did he ever mention the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Sirama.</hi> My Siſter was wholly devoted to my Intereſt, and always found her happineſs in mine.</p>
                     <p>One Evening the Duke ſent for me to his Chamber, and after he had made me ſit down by him, <hi>Martius,</hi> (ſaid he with a kinder air
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:179798:103"/> than uſual) I have long obſerv'd that indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency with which you treat the Counteſs, and have conſider'd that Love which has always poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt you for <hi>Xenſa</hi>'s fair Daughter; and tho' I confeſs ſhe deſerves all that paſſion you have for her, I ſee it with ſorrow, and could wiſh your judgment might preſent to your View thoſe difficulties which are to be o'recome, e're this Match can be perfected, the hatred that Man bears to my Houſe, and how far my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is concern'd in the reſentment of Count <hi>Torruſco</hi>'s death. Here he paus'd ſome time, but ſeeing I did not reply any thing, he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and told me, That, to eaſe me of one Pain, that I might the better endure another, he was reſolv'd to Marry <hi>Ericis</hi> himſelf, for the next morning ſhould finiſh the Work, if <hi>Coloa</hi> was not deſtitute of Prieſts; that he had made it a ſecret till now, becauſe good things unlook'd for impart moſt of pleaſure, and conſequently this news would bring me more of happineſs. This ſaid, he expected my Anſwer and Thanks, inſtead of which I threw my ſelf at his Feet, and conjur'd him to remember that promiſe he had once made me; that <hi>Xenſa</hi> bad kill'd <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſco</hi> Honourably, and that his hatred to our Family proceeded only from that which he ſaw <hi>Mangroa</hi> had to his. As for the Counteſs of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rama</hi> he ſhould add infinitely to my Misfortunes, if he marry'd her, for ſhe was a Woman virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous only to thoſe who had not carefully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd her Conduct; and thereupon told him the whole ſtory of that night's Ramble, as I have already related it. The Duke was infinitely ſurpris'd, and for ſome time remain'd ſilent,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:179798:103"/> then on a ſudden throwing his Arms about my Neck, he ſwore he deſerv'd not a Son ſo dutiful; that he had hitherto us'd me unkindly; but that his future Actions ſhould attone for thoſe paſt, and if I wou'd promiſe to abandon the bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sirena,</hi> to whom <hi>Bonzeda</hi> was to be Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd, I might begin my Journey for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try when <hi>I</hi> pleas'd <hi>I</hi> return'd him that anſwer my Duty and his Kindneſs requir'd; and withal aſſur'd him the Count's happineſs ſhould not be diſturb'd, that <hi>I</hi> would endeavour to Love <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derina</hi> as much as <hi>I</hi> had done <hi>Xenſa</hi>'s Daughter, and ſhould make it my Study to preſerve by merit that place in his good opinion, to which his goodneſs without that had advanc'd me. He was ſatisfied with what I ſaid, and for that time left me without any diminution of my hopes. In the Morning he writ the following Lines to his Bride.</p>

                     <p>The detected Fair One was o'rewhelm'd with ſorrow at the firſt reading of the Duke's Letter, and after ſhe had for ſome time given way to Tears,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:179798:104"/> (ſometimes in Women the natural ſigns of grief or pain) Anger and Revenge (the darling paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that tempting Sex) took place, and ſhe imagin'd with her ſelf a thouſand means and ways to bring diſtraction to our Family. But willing firſt to uſe the force of her Charms, ſhe came to our Houſe dreſs'd in ſmiles, and modeſt looks. My Father waited upon her, and ſhow'd more of ſorrow for his loſs, than Pride or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment for the misfortune of this cunning Fair. She talk'd a while of things indifferent; and at laſt fell upon the Subject of that Letter he had ſent to her. At which time the Duke gave the ſign, and I (as he had commanded) enter'd. She ſoon perceiv'd her Ring, (for I had put it on for that end) and with tears in her Eyes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, confirming ſufficiently the truth of all <hi>I</hi> had ſaid. In ſhort, my dear Friend, I began my Journey that Evening for <hi>Zenitha,</hi> tho' not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I</hi> had receiv'd your kind Letter, and had aſſur'd <hi>Indoretta</hi> of your Conſtancy.

                     <p> In the mean time I knew nothing of my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's happineſs, and when he came home (tho' he ſtrove to hide it, becauſe the Duke was preſent) I cou'd read in his Eyes ſome ſigns of thoſe hopes and motions of Joy which had wing'd his Soul. <hi>Xenſa</hi> was no ſooner gone, than he embrac'd me. Ah! My Dear Siſter (cry'd he) <hi>I</hi> am ſtill hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, <hi>Martius</hi> proves a juſt Friend, and <hi>Indoretta</hi> waits for the Fortunate <hi>Artaxus.</hi> Theſe words pleaſantly ſurpris'd me; <hi>I</hi> lov'd too much to be diſintereſted in the Story, and begg'd with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency he would let me know where he had this account of his and my good Fortune. Then it was, Madam, he related the Story of my Lover's abſence, the ſame as <hi>I</hi> have already Writ it; adding he had given him the Key of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Door, and we might meet with all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy imaginable. Love, not he, perſwaded, and <hi>I</hi> thought time mov'd backwards till the hour arriv'd.</p>
                     <p>It was when every Creature ſeem'd a-ſleep, the heavy Waters murmur'd as they went, and mov'd as if they ſhortly meant to reſt; the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning Shoar no raging Billows knew, and every Fiſh dreamt in his Ouſie Bed. The Earth ſeem'd all one Cave, the Heav'ns one ſhade, and dying Stars did the new light invite. All happy Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers lay in ſlumbers chain'd, and <hi>Cynthia</hi> to her <hi>Damon</hi> ſeems forgot. The waking Joys of migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Love were fled, and <hi>Morpheus</hi> reign'd when that Young God gave way. Sometimes a Bird half waking took the Wing, and with ſlow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reach'd ſome neighb'ring bough, then faintly murmuring huſh'd it ſelf to reſt, and ſleeping bill'd as if its Mate were nigh. 'Twas then, <hi>I</hi>
                        <pb n="118" facs="tcp:179798:105"/> ſay, Madam, <hi>Artaxus</hi> and <hi>I</hi> ſtole gently forth, to meet the wiſh'd for welcome gen'rous paſſionate <hi>Martius.</hi> As we enter'd the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the Lovely Youth ruſh'd in; Fancy (that erring guide where Judgment's gone) paints him with all his Charms, and perfect thoughts ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd the want of day. I ſaw him kneeling, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging at my Feet, graſping my hands, and ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he ſpoke, his Eyes (at leaſt I thought ſo) darted Love, and all his trembling touches reach'd my Heart. Faultring he cry'd, <hi>Sirena!</hi> Lovely Fair! Now all the pains of abſence are repay'd, and preſent Bleſſings baniſh rooted cares. <hi>Artaxus,</hi> thou beſt of Friends, to thee I owe this mighty happineſs, and if the Charming Miſtreſs of my Vows had any favourable thoughts for the conſtant <hi>Martius,</hi> of which her Brother's Love is not the Cauſe, even that Joy which thoſe thoughts wou'd impart to me, I'd own the effect of his Friendſhip, or her Mercy, without reſpect to Merit on my part.</p>
                     <p>My Heart was ſeiz'd with tenderneſs and joy, I long had lov'd him, and had mourn'd his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and all his words (like Arrows ſhot from Love) dart to my Soul, and kindle dying flames. Night made him bold, and Paſſion ſpurr'd him on, and in this rapture riſing from the ground, he claſp'd me in his Arms, ſigh'd deep, and kiſs'd me with an eager action, and almoſt baniſh'd Virtue from my Breaſt. After we had ſeated our ſelves in an Arbour, we diſcours'd of Love, of the pains that Paſſion brings, and day arriv'd e're we had thought it nigh.</p>
                     <p>In the morning he waited upon the Count, and was by his Siſter (the Fair <hi>Manderina)</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:179798:105"/> with that Modeſty, which Young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men generally profeſs, eſpecially before thoſe whom they ſee deſign'd their Husbands. <hi>Xenſa</hi> was ſoon acquainted with the arrival (as he judg'd him) of his Young Enemy; and waited impatiently for <hi>Bonzeda</hi>'s viſit, who no ſooner came, than he inform'd him of his fears, and to prevent future danger, reſolv'd to ſee me ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly married. The hated Lover was o'rejoy'd at the propoſal, and the third day following was prefix'd for that, on which this Gordian Knot was to be ty'd. My Mother acquainted me with the unwelcome news, and I fail'd not to beg that aſſiſtance ſhe had often promiſed; and with Tears in my Eyes let her know how much I hated <hi>Bonzeda,</hi> and what thoughts I had for the Young <hi>Mangroa.</hi> She ſighing told me, That things were now come to the laſt extremity, that <hi>I</hi> had been married ſome weeks ago, if her Friendſhip had been wanting, or diligence aſleep. That the Young Duke's Arrival gave the Count and my Father ſo many fears, that Arguments were become uſeleſs, and my Marriage alone was able to ſecure them. But that one Remedy, or at leaſt a Reprieve, offer'd it ſelf, which was to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd thus. I ſhould immediately feign my ſelf indiſpos'd, confine my ſelf to my Chamber for ſome days, and if the Duke ſtill continued reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, at laſt to my Bed.

                     <p> I comply'd ſo readily with this reliſhing Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, that when the Duke enter'd my Chamber <hi>I</hi> immediately fainted. He call'd for help, and the Dutcheſs (who knew my Diſtemper) came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (drown'd in feign'd Tears) to my Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; telling him, <hi>I</hi> had been under this indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſome days, that ſhe wonder'd at the cauſe, and fear'd ſome dangerous conſequence. <hi>Xenſa</hi> was ſurpris'd with what he heard, and the Count (who was with him) had only this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that he ſaw me incapable of holding any Correſpondence with his Rival. However they both departed without acquainting me with what they had deſign'd the preceeding day. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxus</hi> was perfectly vers'd in the Plot, and told me <hi>Martius</hi> would wait upon me at Night; that <hi>I</hi> muſt not deny him that happineſs, that none could be conſcious to the interview, and every thing conduc'd to promote the deſign. I lov'd, and a few Arguments ſerv'd to perſwade; the Youth poſſeſs'd my Heart, and all my thoughts center'd in forming lovely Ideas of the bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conquerour. He had free acceſs to <hi>Bonze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>'s Garden, and by a ſmall Ladder of Ropes (made for the purpoſe) he eaſily got into ours. His Servant (as ſoon as he had aſcended the Wall) was order'd to Withdraw the Pliant Stairs, and retire to his Maſter's Room, leaſt his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtay had occaſion'd a diſcovery; for <hi>Bonze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> had many Windows oppoſite to that place. My Brother waited at the Window (to which a ſecond Ladder was faſtned) and receiv'd him. The Duke lay in the next Room, and you may believe we forgot not to tread ſoftly. The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Youth caught me in his Arms, gaz'd, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:179798:106"/> ſigh'd, as if this had been our firſt meeting, ſince my departure from <hi>Coloa.</hi> He ſwore no time or accident ſhou'd weaken his Love, that he wou'd ſhow the Conſtancy of a Martyr, who ſuffer'd for Eternal Joys; Nature ſhou'd ſtart, and all things ſuffer change, the Frame of Beings inverted, the Earth turn'd into its primitive Chaos, e're he forgot my Charms. That if the Globe ſhook beneath him, or gap'd ſo wide, it ſhow'd the infernal Powers, howling and grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ratling in their Chains, and all the Souls of damn'd departed men; or if the Skies ſhou'd ſink by ſlow degrees, until the Cryſtal Arch preſs'd down his Head, he'd not fear or dream of coming death, his thoughts ſhou'd then pay homage to his Love, and in this vaſt and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Confuſion, he'd claſp the Fair, the lovely, bleſt <hi>Sirena,</hi> lay her all trembling to his faithful Breaſt, and then poſſeſs'd of all Heav'n could beſtow, he'd ſmile, and ſinking kiſs the precious treaſure, laugh at the angry gods, and bleſs his glorious fall.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſpent the few hours; he ſtill ſwore he lov'd, and my Eyes inform'd him how readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believ'd. But the Servant returning gave the uſual ſign, and we parted, tho' not before we had made a new Appointment.</p>
                     <p>The following day appear'd to both an Age, and Time ſeem'd drowſie by his tardy flight; at laſt the hour much wiſh'd for took its place, and brought the Welcome Lover to my Soul. My Brother (if by deſign or chance <hi>I</hi> know not) was abſent, and we enjoy'd a Heaven without diſturbance. For tho' he was much eſteem'd by <hi>Martius</hi> and belov'd by me, yet we were both
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:179798:107"/> glad of his abſence. We ſpoke a thouſand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant things, and Love to us appear'd the darling Virtue of the World, the end for which we were made, and the very Cauſe of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He ſigh'd, and gaz'd upon me, ſpoke ſometimes faintly, and in a Minute would grow ſilent, graſp my hand, kiſs it, and almoſt breath out his Soul in raptures. I felt a ſick'ning plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at my Heart, a longing joy diſtracted my Soul, and <hi>I</hi> wanted ſomething to compleat the Bliſs, yet knew not what it was; my Blood fluſh'd to and fro, ſeem'd all in every part, and in no part to ſtay, but ſpoke my Nature toſs'd 'twixt fear and gladneſs. While thus we ſat bleſt with our preſent fortune, yet uneaſie in the anxious wiſhes of a better, loſing the preſent ſweets in thoughts of more; a ſudden noiſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd us in this Lethargy, and wak'd us from an extaſie of Love. My fears on this occaſion were inexpreſſible, and (knowing it too late to make uſe of our hempen Stairs) I caught my bluſhing Lover by the hand, conjur'd him to ſave my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and my quiet, which were now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently in danger, made ſo only by my Love to him He who knew how to Obey, ſmil'd, and plac'd himſelf behind my Bed, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd unſeen. The Duke ſoon knock'd at the Door, and I as expeditiouſly opened it. Ha! Daughter (cry'd he) I'm glad 'tis no worſe, I heard ſome ſmall noiſe in your Chamber, and was concern'd for your health. This I took for my Cue, and with a faint voice anſwered; that I had been ill moſt of that day, but that I was now grown better, Ah! reply'd the Duke (who ſtood ſhaking in his Night-Gown) you've been
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:179798:107"/> too long from your Bed, 'tis there you muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect reſt, for ſleep to the Sick is a reprieve from pain. This allarm'd my Soul, and I made uſe of all the Arguments I could invent, to ſhow the inconveniency of that Method he propos'd to perfect my recovery; but 'twas in vain; he call'd for the Dutcheſs, and ſhe (not knowing the Circumſtance of affairs) confirm'd him in his Reſolution. He withdrew into the next Room, and ſhe ſtaid by me, as if I had ſtood in need of her Aſſiſtance e're I could be undreſt. Thus I was oblig'd to obey; and the Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning took my Mother by the hand, and ſo left me, having firſt wiſh'd me good health, commended <hi>Bonzeda,</hi> and order'd one of the Maids to remove the Candles. My Charming <hi>Martius</hi> thus reliev'd, threw himſelf upon his knees, claſp'd my hand, and ſigh'd, as if his winged, ſlippery Soul, had ſought an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to eſcape its Priſon; his continued ſilence, and eager graſps ſpoke him languiſhing for a Joy unknown, and I (divided between Love, Fear, and Honour) found my ſelf unable to ſpeak my thoughts. Sudden motions of alternate Paſſions ſtopt my faultering Tongue, and my boſom eccho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moving ſighs to his. While thus our Souls and Nature ſeem'd at War, he gently mov'd and caught me in his Arms, laid his Head to my panting Breaſt, trembl'd, breath'd quick, and kiſs'd me with the eagerneſs of departing Lovers. Then giving way to a flaſh of Love inflam'd, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I begg'd (but 'twas faintly) he'd leave me; I told him his Servant no doubt wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his return, becauſe the time appointed was elaps'd, and if he walkt too long in the Garden, it might diſcover what our mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt oblig'd us to conceal. He made no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but ſtopt the ſound of Arguments with kiſſes, Love reaſum'd his Throne, and ſet his Soul on Fire.

The Night was ſpent with all the pleaſure Love could give, he ſwore eternal Conſtancy, <hi>I</hi> believ'd all, lov'd all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and dreamt my ſelf in Paradiſe. Sleep was to both a ſtranger, and coming Day prov'd hateful to the ſight, we ſhrinkt and ſmil'd and wiſh'd a Night like that, in which great <hi>Jove</hi> his dear <hi>Alemena</hi> bleſt, inverting order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his Joys. At laſt we parted, but with thoſe pleaſant deſires which Men enjoy, when dreaming of a Heaven they ne're poſſeſt, or know but faintly in a tempting trance, they grieve their judgment was no longer huſht, and wiſh and long to ſee the Scene again.</p>
                     <p>In the morning the Duke came to ſee me, the Count was with him, and both of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd I had not ſlept laſt Night; that my eyes verifi'd this truth, and I was unjuſt to my ſelf in not having a greater regard for my Health. The freſh remembrance of what had paſt made <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeda</hi>'s
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:179798:108"/> viſit more unwelcome than ever, and my averſion for him almoſt caſt me into a Feaver. <hi>Xenſa</hi> who obſerv'd my diſorder, but not the Cauſe, preſently left me, after he had told me, that he hop'd a few Days would bring me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect eaſe, and give him that happineſs he had ſo often wiſh'd, of ſeeing me married to his Friend, a Man who well deſerv'd my eſteem, and lov'd me paſſionately.</p>
                     <p>A few minutes thereafter <hi>Artaxus</hi> enter'd, and told me he had been at <hi>Bonzeda</hi>'s, had ſeen my favourite Lover, and was reſolv'd to go to <hi>Coloa;</hi> that he could live no longer without his <hi>Indoretta,</hi> and he'd rather chuſe to forfeit his Father's kindneſs and fortune, than endure the loſs of her he lov'd; adding withal, that <hi>Martius</hi> had perſwaded him to't. Theſe laſt words gave me a vaſt deal of Pleaſure; 'twas an argument of his Love, and ſpoke the laſt nights Joy's had rather fann'd than extinguiſh'd his Flame. This made me (beſides the help of my natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations that pleaded powerfully for him) eaſily reſolve to ſee him again at the uſual hour. In the mean time my Brother ply'd the Duke for his conſent: He weigh'd not at firſt the Cauſe of his Journey, and <hi>Artaxus</hi> (promiſing to return in a few Days) eaſily obtain'd the favour deſir'd. But as he was ready to take Horſe he receiv'd new Orders, for <hi>Xenſa,</hi> upon ſecond Thoughts, began to ſuſpect the buſineſs, and therefore charg'd him not to think of going to Court, 'till my Marriage with the Count ſhould be accompliſh'd. <hi>Artaxus</hi> ſtorm'd and rav'd at this ſudden change of his humour, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring Love more than Intereſt, took Poſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:179798:109"/> for <hi>Coloa.</hi> The Duke was then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in his ſuſpicions; and ſwore this manifeſt token of his diſobedience ſhould never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got; that he'd remember him no more as his Son, and damn the hour that brought him firſt to light. The Dutcheſs forgot nothing that might excuſe his fault; ſhe inſiſted on the force of Almighty Love, on the number of his Years, and how inſupportable 'twas for Youth to be mew'd up in a Caſtle, or confin'd to the narrow bounds of a Garden: But her Arguments were of no ſtrength, and <hi>Bonzeda</hi>'s Agents in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily added matter to the Fire of the Duke's wrath.</p>
                     <p>At night my Lover beat his uſual Road, and enter'd my Chamber with that joy in his Face, which ſpoke his Soul at eaſe. I receiv'd him with that ſondneſs which my Love inſpir'd, and we conſum'd the hours in amorous Sighs, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing looks, firing Touches, melting Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and eager Wiſhes. He long'd to renew thoſe joys which rowſing moving Nature taught to both; and I, who doated too much, (yet willing to preſerve his Love in health) deny'd him the opportunity of a ſurfeit, made the Heaven almoſt inacceſſible, yet allow'd him thoſe priviledges which ſerv'd to kindle his Soul, and make it burn for more. Thus, Madam, we liv'd happy, by ſtarving our ſelves in midſt of Plenty, and heightning the appetite by ſcanty Joys, to a mad hunger for a waſte of Pleaſure. My Marriage was ſtill deferr'd, and <hi>Artaxus</hi> ſent me a perfect Journal of his proceedings by every Poſt. But wearied with my continued Confinement, I ſometimes (and at the Duke's
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:179798:109"/> deſire too) walk'd abroad: The Sea-ſhoar was the place I commonly choſe, which at laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd this adventure.</p>
                     <p>All ſilent were, no Beaſt was ſeen to roam, his panting Flocks each Shepherd homewards drove, the Labourer left his Plow and wiſely ſought for ſhelter from that heat which ſcorch'd the Earth. I ſate beneath a moſſy Rock, on each ſide Clifts and frightful Precipices, dark Receſſes and ſolitary Caves, not made by art but ow'd their form to Nature. The bubling Streams with noiſe came tumbling down, daſhing from Point to Point their ſcatter'd Parts, then meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing roar'd and ruſh'd into the Main; who all receiv'd next minute toſt 'em back, and kept them in perpetual motion, till the Sun's attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive rays exhal'd the foam from much concuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wrought, and ſuck'd the ſtranger body from the reſt. This melancholly retreat gave me inexpreſſible Satisfaction, I view'd the irkſome Shades with greedineſs, and languiſh'd with the pleaſure. My Maid was ſilent, and nothing offer'd it ſelf to diſturb my contemplative Soul. While thus I ſate and gaz'd upon the Waves, who now appear'd like Ice or Cryſtal Fields, (not one breath of wind dividing the united Element) the Skies (quick as thought) grew black, the ſluces of the burden'd Clouds flew open, and you'd thought the Heavens had mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Rain. The Birds who ſought their Prey upon the Waves, found a new freſh Sea above them, and ſunk beneath the ſmarting weight into the briny old. Thunder ſoon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the amazing change, and burſting Clouds ſhook the tottering Globe. Fire flaſh'd through
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:179798:110"/> the thickned Air, and ſhow'd the gaping Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the Skies in labour, and the jarring Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at a dreadful War. The ſcaley Monſters ſhow'd their aweful Heads, and rouz'd from the bottom of the boundleſs deep, howl'd, and threw up floods of gorging Waves to quench the diſtant heat, then grinning plung'd to hide themſelves from Heaven. The diſtant plains ſeem'd all a heap of Rubbiſh, forſaken by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Beaſt, and cover'd with the Wreck, which rowling floods from neighbouring Mountains brought. To encreaſe the frightful Scene, the winds grew high, tore up the ſtubborn Oaks and yielding Pines, ranſack'd the plains, and ſwept off the budding Corns, levelling the ſuperb Palace with the humble Cottage. The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering trembling Swains dejected ſtood, and ſaw their Huts tranſported from their Seats, and plac'd on Rocks, or on ſome riſing Grounds, whoſe height ſecur'd them from aſpiring Streams. In a word, Nature ſeem'd mad, the Elements in a freak, and the Earth grumbl'd as if a fatal Collick had rent her peaceful Bowels. You may believe, Madam, my Soul was ſurpris'd with the amazing ſight, and <hi>I</hi> dreamt of nothing more than preſent ruin. My Maid fell upon her Knees, begg'd the protection of the angry gods, and ſwore eternal conſtancy to Heaven, if once reliev'd from theſe diſtracting Fears. While thus ſhe was imploy'd, I could perceive a large Veſſel toſt by raging Billows, labouring to reach the open Seas, yet forc'd on ſhoar by Winds. Pity on a ſudden fill'd my Breaſt, and I had ſo many anxious Thoughts, for the ſafety of thoſe in a more imminent danger than my ſelf, that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:179798:110"/> my paſt fears vaniſh'd, and all my cares and wiſhes were for them. Juſt now you'd thought the floating Caſtle ſtood on a high Mountain, making War with Heaven, and proudly threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to aſſail the Clouds. Then in a moment all its height was loſt, and ſinking Seas would plunge it deep as Hell. At laſt the crowding Waves ruſh'd doubly on, and forc'd the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Palace againſt a Rock. The Seamen ſhriek'd aloud, ſtruggl'd for parting Life, and the next moment vaniſh'd. The ſad Object mov'd my Tears, and <hi>I</hi> could have fainted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weight of other People's Misfortunes, if a certain joy (at that time not known for ſuch, but ariſing from a ſenſe of my own ſafety) had not ſupported me. The greateſt part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind loves to ſee his fellow Creature in evident danger; and tho' he views him with trouble, yet if he examin'd himſelf narrowly, he'd find the remembrance of his own Condition, (when compar'd to that of the other) gives a certain pleaſure that counterballances the Pain; elſe why ſhould we at any time flock to ſee Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Combats, Shipwracks, raging Fires, and ſuch horrour-giving Objects; for Nature is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to its Enemy, and grief no doubt is ſuch—But to return, the Clouds who had now ſhak'd their droping Wings withdrew. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Curtain furl'd up, and Heaven ſhow'd a ſmiling Countenance, as if a Sacrifice of ſo many Lives had aſſwag'd its hungry fury. <hi>Eolus</hi> ſounded a retreat to the raving Winds, who grumbling retir'd to their hated Priſon, and <hi>Neptune</hi> (reliev'd from his old Diſturber) ſlept as if the paſt toils had forc'd him to a Peace. The
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:179798:111"/> joyful Birds came fluttering from their Neſts, ſprung through the Air, and trod the Boughs again, then Sung, and mounting ſpread their matted Wings. In fine, every thing ſeem'd at liberty, but <hi>Sirena,</hi> my grief for what I had ſeen ſunk my Soul into a demi-trance, and left me not the power to move. I conſider'd the quality of that inconſtant Element, the Cauſe of Winds and Rains, how far Chance, the gods and Nature, ſhar'd in what befel us; and if Heaven (which we paint all Goodneſs and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) could have a hand in the deſtruction of ſo many Creatures, which it ſelf had made, or took a certain pleaſure in the puniſhment of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, whoſe Actions were ſo inconſiderable and ſeemingly below the notice of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Mind. Thus my Soul travers'd a Labyrinth of myſterious Problems, my Reaſon exerted its Power, and almoſt ſhook off the Yoak of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſearching into the truth of things, which believ'd bring no ill conſequences, if not a real happineſs, and if rejected or diſcredited, give Nature her ſway, and ſet the World looſe, break the hinges of humane Society, and ſet up an Inſurance Office for Villanies and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, Night approach'd, and I was oblig'd to abandon my ſolitary Tent. But, oh kind Heavens! how was <hi>I</hi> ſurpris'd, when on the Sand two Shipwrackt Bodies lay, in faſt embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces lockt, as if the dead Clay had retain'd a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect remembrance of that Union which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Souls. Coming nearer, their Cloaths inform'd me they were of Quality, and <hi>I</hi> ſtood ſometime motionleſs, and gaz'd upon the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:179798:111"/> Object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the ruines of ſo many Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſo ſweet appear'd, you'd thought death had been a gentle ſleep, and cruel Waves been ſoft as Summer dews. In this juncture the Duke (who had dreaded the effects of the paſt Storm) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd; and tho' naturally hardy and of a rough diſpoſition; his Soul melted at the ſight, and his Eyes confeſs'd the trouble of his Mind. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently order'd his Servants to convey the dead to his Houſe, and having ſeated our ſelves in the Coach, drove ſtraight home.</p>
                     <p>Some hours after, one of my Maids came running into my Cloſet, and with gladneſs told me, that the Lady whom I found on the ſhoar was yet alive, that her Soul was loath to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſo fair a body, and they had ſome hopes of her recovery. But the Man was loſt beyond redemption, for not one ſign or Symptom of coming Life appear'd. This news baniſh'd that grief which had lately poſſeſt me for the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Fair; and I flew between hopes and fears to give that aſſiſtance in my power. When I enter'd, the ſick one lifted up her Eyes, look'd fix'dly upon every Object, mov'd her Lips as if ſhe had ſtrove to ſpeak, then ſigh'd and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut them both again. The Dutcheſs us'd her utmoſt Art, and drove back the poſting Soul when almoſt gone. But having ſpent the greateſt part of the Night in this Charitable Imployment, we withdrew; leaving the care of our Charming gueſt to my Mother's Maids and mine.</p>
                     <p>The joyful Birds had ſcarce uſher'd in the coming day when I aroſe. I had dreamt of this unfortunate fair One all Night, and my wiſhes for her ſafety became the imployment of my
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:179798:112"/> anxious Soul. Nor did I Petition Heaven in vain, for when I enter'd the Room, ſhe mo'vd her Head from the Bed, and in an almoſt-dying ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, begg'd Pardon for that trouble ſhe had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, thank'd me for my aſſiſtance, then ask'd me the place and time in which I found her, if I had ſeen her Husband on the Shoar, for now all her fears were for him, and if he was loſt, no Art, no Argument, or Cauſe could ſave her Life, her Soul was incorporate and mix'd with his, and both ſhould wander in the other World, if not united there like Bodies here.</p>
                     <p>That tenderneſs her loſs inſpir'd, drew Tears from my Eyes, and I faintly anſwer'd,—I had ſeen none ſuch, that ſhe alone had reach'd that part of the Shoar where I had been, but that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſhould be given to enquire of all the ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling Shepherds, and watchful Fiſhermen for him ſhe wanted, that Heaven no doubt had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd him, and ſhe would ſoon be happy. The diſtreſs'd Fair One ſigh'd, conjur'd me to uſe my utmoſt diligence in the ſearch, and to remember her life depended on the ſucceſs. In the mean time the Duke order'd the dead Body to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd, according to the cuſtom of our Country, where nothing was wanting, which Quality have beſtow'd upon them, as the laſt mark of Honour. For by that account which the Fair One gave of him, we perfectly knew him for her Husband. The Dutcheſs (whoſe grief upon this occaſion was in nothing inferiour to mine) advis'd me to acquaint the ignorant Widow with her ſtate, to prevent a double pain, which the certain knowledge of her Circumſtances would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs give. I obey'd, and in the Evening enter'd
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:179798:112"/> her Chamber with a Golden Croſs (beſet with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mall Diamonds) in my hand. The mourning Fair no ſooner eſpy'd me, than ſtarting, (ſhe cry'd) is he alive? Has he ſent me this pledge which has coſt me ſo many Tears? Am I happy? Or muſt I dye? Tears ruſh'd into my Eyes, and ſudden grief deny'd me the uſe of Words. I ſtood ſome minutes ſilent, and at laſt confeſs'd him dead. At this unwelcome ſound the unhappy Fair (with a Countenance pale as death) leant her declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Head upon the Pillow, lifted up her hands, and cry'd, O! Unhappy <hi>Delia!</hi> thou haſt loſt—and then fainted. I apply'd thoſe Remedies commonly us'd on ſuch occaſions, and by the force of Spirits deny'd a flight to hers. Oh Gods! when ſhe lifted up her Eyes again, how my Soul ſorrowed for her. So dying Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes covered o're with dew, look gay, and freſh, and tempting to the ſight; yet move the Heart, becauſe their ſweets are flying. Ah! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, (cry'd ſhe) Pardon this undecent, but juſt grief, let not my Tears diſturb your Peace, for a few hours will give me reſt for ever. My Soul murmurs at its tedious impriſonment, rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes and ſhakes it ſelf beneath this load of Clay, longs to be gone, and flutters in its Cage; 'tis now a traveller wrapt in contemplation, ſurveys the happy ſtate of ſeparate Beings, Chalks out the way to Heaven through open Air, and longs and ſeeks <hi>Valentio</hi> as it mounts.—Oh my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band!—Oh unfortunate ſurviving <hi>Delia!—</hi>This ſaid, ſhe ſigh'd, as if her heaving Breaſts had preſt her riſing Soul, and I (now a ſharer in her ſufferings) wept, and in my ſilence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt the pains that rackt my eaſie Heart. She
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:179798:113"/> who amidſt her own troubles forgot not mine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd me to leave her, and to forget I ever ſaw her; begg'd my Pardon again for thoſe Tears her misfortune had brought me, and ſwore that no temptation ſhould fool her into a love of Life. I ſet before her (with more affection than Art) the inconveniency of immoderate grief, taught her to hope a better fortune, and rely on Heaven. But ſhe (dumb with exceſs of ſorrow) made no reply, preſt my hand between hers, ſigh'd, and cry'd <hi>Valentio!</hi> Unwilling to be gone, I ſeated my ſelf upon her Beds ſide, and with Tears beſought her to remember the preſent ſtate of her health, the impoſſibility of retrieving what was paſt, and that her Stars, though cruel in other things, had been kind in bringing her to a Houſe, where ſhe might freely command as at home. She who was no ſtranger to good breeding, and in the depth of affliction ſhow'd a ready mind, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpeak, gave me an obliging return; add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that my cares augmented the weight of hers, and ſerv'd to haſten the o'reburden'd Soul to an end of all its Labours. But that to repay part of thoſe kindneſſes I had ſhown, ſhe'd acquaint me with her life on whom they were beſtow'd, that the recital of her paſt adventures, or emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Love, was now the only pleaſure of which ſhe was capable: For the remembrance of Joys long fled, brought back the happier State of Life, and match'd it with the preſent; then ſhow'd how far we fell, how low we ſunk, and Charm'd the melancholy Hypocondriack Soul with a full taſte of miſery; the ſweets of the one encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſenſe of the other's bitterneſs. I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to divert her reſolution, and defer that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:179798:113"/> account ſhe offer'd till her Health could conſent to the labour; but 'twas in vain, for the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs'd Fair, after a few deep ſighs and dying looks, began as followeth.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <p>THE Kingdom of <hi>Marintha</hi> (to which I owe my Birth) was long diſtracted with the fury of a Civil War, the two pretenders to the Crown <hi>(Othar</hi> and <hi>Decius)</hi> divided the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he who ſignalized himſelf for neither of the Parties, was liable to the outrages of both, and judg'd a common Enemy, or at leaſt one that had no regard to the welfare of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but to his own intereſt; and waited with a ſemblance of quiet, till Fate ſhould decide the difference, and Crown the Conquerour, to whom he might ſafely pay homage, and ſecure his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. In the mean time my Father, who was naturally Loyal, ſided with <hi>Decius,</hi> whoſe Party then was weakeſt, while his Younger Brother (to whom Mony was a God) fled to <hi>Othar</hi>'s Camp, and there was receiv'd as a Man who brings ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Gold to a Prince in wants. The two Young Kings (for both were Crown'd, and maintain'd an equal Title to the Throne) impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of delays, and fond to reach a Diadem in view, at laſt encamp'd in a large Plain, where each of them waited for the nearer advances of the other. In a few days the eager Armies met, Victory hover'd o're their Heads, view'd the terrible Combat with a ſecret Joy, then clapt her bloody Wings, and perch'd at laſt on cruel <hi>Othar</hi>'s Standard. Here poor <hi>Decius</hi> fell in ſearch of Power, and my Father (whoſe Quality
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:179798:114"/> and Poſt in the Army advanc'd him to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Perſon) loſt his Life in his defence.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Othar</hi> Conquer'd, Fame flew before his Arms, and brought the ſad news to that part of the Country, which had own'd the deceas'd for their King; and my Mother, who ſoon became acquainted with her loſs, fled into the other World to ſecure her ſelf from an Addition to her misfortunes in this. My Uncle, (the unkind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt <hi>Arates)</hi> now Maſter of the new Monarch's favour, forgot that reſpect he ow'd to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his Elder Brother; and having purchas'd with a bribe the gift of his Eſtate (which the King had now taken into his own hands as a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture upon the ſcore of Rebellion) he poſſeſt himſelf of the Houſe, diſcharg'd the old Servants, and kept not one in his Family but my ſelf, that e're had ſeen or known the kinder Maſter. I was yet too Young to be ſenſible of my own miſery, and ſmil'd and play'd about this Author of all my following ills. But reaching too ſoon the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Year of my Age, and my Face promiſing a larger ſtock of coming Beauties and good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Neighbouring Youth began to take notice of me, to ſpeak kindly to me, pay me much reſpect, covet to be nigh me, and ſighing, often inform'd me of my Circumſtances, and that my Eyes would purchaſe more than cruel fortune had robb'd me of <hi>Arates</hi> obſerv'd my budding power, and wiſely foreſaw that if I ſhould marry to a Man of a good Eſtate, I might (aſſiſted by the help of Wealth) lay a claim to what he poſſeſs'd of mine, and to prevent that Misfortune which his guilt taught him to fear;

Thus he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the common Cuſtom; and inſtead of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Portion, he ſet his Niece to Sale, yet half aſſur'd that none would buy her at a price ſo large.</p>
                     <p>My Lovers in ſhoals withdrew; at Night no muſick reach'd my longing Ear, no ſighs but thoſe the old Matron vented for her decay'd Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and chill'd Blood.

Thus the ignorant (with the height of Devotion) bleſs Heaven for a Miſchief, and when infernal Powers ſend a Plague, they thank that greater Power, whoſe Anger for committed Crimes, only permitted the ill to be to puniſh ſtiff offenders. Thus we ſpent the tedious day, and my long impriſonment had almoſt taught my Soul to forget the thoughts of Liberty; when the dear, the loving, but the loſt <hi>Valentio,</hi> (who ſtill had ſhown a Love beyond what mine, or the nobleſt Beauty could claim as due) at laſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd the payment of the Sum propos'd The old Miſer was ſtartled with the News, and told him ſince his all was ſpent in the purſuit of a Woman, he muſt expect to live a marry'd beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.

For, Madam, the form of Government in <hi>Marintha</hi> differs from that of <hi>Fabria,</hi> and there Men often do themſelves Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice without having recourſe to Law, while the Prince (whoſe Authority is limited by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or a choſen number inveſted with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the whole) winks at theſe Outrages, and ſees the ſtrong o'rethrow the injur'd weak, without offering to diſturb the courſe of either.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time I was kept wholly ignorant of theſe Tranſactions, and was ſtrangely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:179798:115"/> when (after a conſinement of two long Years, where I was ſeen by none, but my old Governeſs) the Gay, the Joyful, bleſt <hi>Valentio</hi> enter'd. I thought he too had forgot me, and thoſe ſparkles of Love he had kindl'd in my Breaſt e're my Impriſonment, were now almoſt extinguiſh'd, or at leaſt burnt ſo faintly, I ſcarce perceiv'd the flame. The amorous Youth fell upon his Knees, darted his Eyes on mine, ſigh'd, and (with a voice that would have charm'd a departing Soul back to Life) ſaid, does the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Delia</hi> remember her ſlave <hi>Valentio?</hi> Can ſhe believe I love her? That my long abſence was an effect of neceſſity, not the will of my Heart? And that now ſhe has liberty, if ſhe can but Love. My ſurpriſe at the unexpected acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent made me uneaſie, <hi>I</hi> felt a new Pleaſure, and had a perfect remembrance of my paſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, knew not what to anſwer, and wiſh'd he'd conſult my Eyes, for the reſolves of my yet wavering Soul. In this confuſion of the mind he graſpt my Hand, forc'd it to his Mouth, and kiſt it with the Feaver of a violent Lover, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd me to remember how <hi>I</hi> had been us'd, to conſult my reaſon before <hi>I</hi> ſpoke, and to make uſe of that opportunity which kind Heaven lent me, leſt my Uncle's humour alter'd to the worſe, made him for ever Miſerable, and gave me no hopes of better Fortune than <hi>I</hi> now enjoy'd. As he ſpoke, <hi>Aratus</hi> enter'd, and with a ſowre Countenance told me he had always ſhown him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a kind Parent, and he came now to give me (in his conſent to my Marriage with <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentio)</hi> a ſenſible mark of that affection he ever had for me. This pleaſant turn of ſporting
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:179798:116"/> Fate elevated my Heart, joy ſparkl'd in my Face, and tho' my reaſon could not find the Cauſe of this quick change, yet <hi>I</hi> was eas'd, becauſe <hi>I</hi> had no ground to doubt the validity of that Proof, which fell within the Cognizance of my ſenſes. Then looking on him <hi>I</hi> lov'd, <hi>I</hi> bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anſwer'd, his Choice was to me a Guide, and <hi>I</hi> ſhould not be wanting in my endeavours to eſteem the Man he deſign'd my Husband. The ſurly old Man ſeem'd pleas'd with what <hi>I</hi> ſaid, and calling my Gouvernantée aſide, they both withdrew.</p>
                     <p>When he was gone, the wonderful <hi>Valentio</hi> fail'd not to thank me for my compliance, and ſpoke all that a Man who lov'd to exceſs could utter to the Miſtreſs of his Soul, and <hi>I</hi> forgot not to weigh his Merit. You may wonder, dear Madam, at the eaſie conqueſt, and that not having mention'd this God-like Youth du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my Confinement, I ſhould now ſo ſuddenly reſign my Heart, and doat upon his Charms. But to remove that, conſider my Years at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that from my infancy, I had more tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and eſteem for him, than for the reſt of Mankind, and that he being then very young, his perſon and the beauties of his Soul, were better'd in the ſpace of two Years; of this laſt, <hi>I</hi> modeſtly inform'd him, and he (who never ſpoke otherwiſe than he believ'd) ſwore mine ſurpris'd him, that <hi>I</hi> was ever the wonder of my Sex, and that Nature had ſpent the time of my long impriſonment, in perfecting that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Work ſhe had begun with ſo much Art.</p>
                     <p>In a few days we were marry'd, and my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle (who could diſſemble handſomely) ſeem'd
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:179798:116"/> well ſatisfied with all that paſt, while <hi>I</hi> (who was wholly ignorant of what my <hi>Valentio</hi> had done for me) promis'd to my ſelf an age of Joys, and eternity of Peace and Happineſs to come. My young Husband's Love encreas'd with the number of his Days, and time that waſtes all things, ſerv'd to augment the force of his flame; for me he ſeem'd to live, and if at any time my nature was diſorder'd, it wrought that effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Soul, which Minds united for each other know. His humour ſpoke his heart ſuſceptible of Love, and capable of any tender impreſſions, ſubject to anger, to revenge a ſtranger, and form'd by bounteous Nature for a Lover. In the day time he was ever nigh me, ſigh'd and ſwore he ne're could Love too well, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the eſteem of all Mankind, and had Eyes of force to melt a ſavage Heart, teach thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to War, practis'd in deeds of horrour, and converſant in blood, to long and languiſh after ſofter Pleaſures. In the Night he ſeem'd uneaſie for nothing but the privation of Light, and when the Sun appear'd he'd gaze upon my Charms, and bleſs the day that brought us firſt together. Then ſurrounding my panting Body with his trembling Arms, he'd ſmile upon me, and ſwear by all the Powers above, and by my ſelf, that no time or accident ſhould e're deface my lovely form which the young god had rooted in his Heart; if withering Age came on, and Nature fail'd, or laid waſte the field of Beauty, he'd call to mind the preſent happy minute, fetch it back from the boundleſs heap of Years long fled, and place it before his Eyes, renew his weaken'd Love, and doat upon his
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:179798:117"/> charming <hi>Delia,</hi> with all the longings of a hot young Lover, who can ne're be bleſt enough; my Eyes ſhould kindle dying flames, we ſhould embrace like Youth, and burn with equal Fires.</p>
                     <p>Thus have we lain and bleſt our mutual For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, heard the cold North Winds battering againſt the Windows, and ſhivering Oxen low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Plains, the Birds chirping on the Battlements; and bleeting Lambs proclaiming double wants, the Trees crackling againſt each other, and tender Bloſſoms wafted throw the Air. Then have we ſhrinkt, lockt our ſelves together, breath'd quick and low, and laught at diſtant Storms, forgot the chilling Airs that rag'd abroad, and play'd and wanton'd on the yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Downs.—But ah! this charming Scene how ſoon it fled! How quick time flew to finiſh ſo much Bliſs! He ſhow'd his hoary Head, and mov'd like Age, to make us think he would have longer ſtaid, but while we lookt about and dreamt no loſs, he mounted ſtreight and left us in diſtreſs. For ſix Months had ſcarce elaps'd, when my Husband began to droop, ſigh when he lookt upon me, frequent the ſolitary Walks, and languiſh under a Diſeaſe unknown. This gave me a thouſand Fears, <hi>I</hi> lov'd as when firſt the Prieſt ſaluted me a Wife, and wiſh'd me happy in a marry'd State, and that melancholy which poſſeſt my dear <hi>Valentio</hi> became Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick, the Servants lookt like Ghoſts of Men, and <hi>I</hi> ſeem'd the reverſe of Woman, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on this ſide or beyond Humanity, my curl'd Locks hang'd looſely in the Air, no ſmiles adorn'd my brow, my Beauties fled, and Love
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:179798:117"/> ſeem'd juſt a dying. A thouſand times I askt the Cauſe, and with Tears in my Eyes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd him to lay open his Heart, to hide none of his thoughts from <hi>Delia,</hi> whoſe very Soul he knew devoted his; that if he lov'd me not, why would he not tell me ſo, and make me happy when he meant me ill, for the killing ſound would reach my fore-boding Heart, and like ſudden Thunder fright and ſtrike me dead. He ſtill ſwore he lov'd me, that his melancholy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from ſome indiſpoſition of his Body, and begg'd I'd inquire no further into the Cauſe; with Tears in my Eyes <hi>I</hi> left him, and all my looks ſpoke my Soul uneaſie.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, my poor <hi>Valentio</hi> became a ſhadow, his Heart was in perpetual agitation, and heav'd his anxious Breaſt, as if the mighty ſecret had ſtruggl'd for a Vent. I obſerv'd this with incredible Pain, and us'd all the arts which Love inſpir'd to extract the hidden Myſtery. At laſt (when even Nature you'd thought nodded, as if the Globe would have ſlipt through her Fingers, and cruſh'd our ſleeping Antipodes) as in Bed we lay, I urg'd my griefs again, bid him remember how <hi>I</hi> ſtill had lov'd, the joys of that Night, when ſmiling Hymen gave his wiſh'd conſent, how <hi>I</hi> lay fainting in his Arms ſick with pleaſure, yet willing to advance his, and wellcoming the new Joy whoſe fierceneſs almoſt drown'd me, how eagerly he graſpt me, how he preſt my Lips, and ſet my Soul on fire, when paſt flames had half conſum'd its ſtrength. He (who now conſider'd, how conſtantly <hi>I</hi> ſhar'd in all his wiſhes) melted into Love, laid aſide the Heart of ſtubborn Man, took me in his Arms,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:179798:118"/> ſigh'd, and cry'd, Ah <hi>Delia</hi> I am ruin'd!—Thou undone!—And curſt <hi>Valentio</hi> is the cauſe of all!</p>
                     <p>'Tis needleſs, Madam, to repeat what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, beſides my ſtrength at preſent tells me, <hi>I</hi> muſt be conciſe. He inform'd me of what had paſt between him and <hi>Arates</hi> before the Marriage, that his Creditors were become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie, that his Friends had abandon'd him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had acted in that affair without conſent or advice, and nothing could ſecure him but a ſpeedy flight. I believ'd my ſelf miſerable, fall'n low from the height of happineſs, and ſpent the tedious Night in Tears, while he (whoſe cares were equal to my own) conjur'd me by that Love <hi>I</hi> bore him, to undergo patiently that load of Poverty, to which his indiſcretion had brought me, to forget the ſcenes of paſt Loves, and to rely upon <hi>Arates</hi> (who could not chuſe but relent) for a return of Fortune; Love was the cauſe, and the Crime was eaſily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd; the weight of his griefs leſſned the ſenſe of my own, and the throbbings of his oppreſt Heart, ſtunn'd my Soul almoſt into a Lethargy. <hi>I</hi> embrac'd him a thouſand times, ſwore the poſſeſſion of his Heart repay'd the loſs of Wealth, and I'd ſhow the Courage of an <hi>Amazon,</hi> under my new Misfortune; begg'd he'd tender his own ſafety, and remember that when <hi>Valentio</hi> dy'd, his <hi>Delia</hi> too was loſt.</p>
                     <p>At laſt the unwelcome Day appear'd, and the afflicted youth ſeem'd plung'd in an abyſs of Deſpair. O gods! How often he did claſp me in his Arms, gaze upon me, and ſigh as if he would have ſunk into Eternity, his rack'd. Soul
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:179798:118"/> ſhook his tender frame, and in the labour forc'd Tears from his eyes, which the manly Youth ſtrove to hide, and toſt in a Sea of o'rewhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cares, remov'd the ſigns of weakneſs from my ſight. Then ſtarting from my embraces he'd cry, muſt <hi>I</hi> leave my <hi>Delia?</hi> Muſt <hi>I</hi> be damn'd to the boundleſs pains of an eternal Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment—Oh can <hi>I</hi> abandon Heaven in view? And ſhut my ſelf for ever from the joys of Paradiſe?—Oh my Guardian Angel, take me once more into thy Boſom, give a new life to my fainting Heart, and teach me to forget my paſt happineſs, or at leaſt to be inſenſible of my coming torment; huſh my warring Soul to reſt, and let me dream no more of what I'm doom'd to ſuffer.—But ah, my <hi>Delia!</hi> My all! Thou better part of divided <hi>Valentio,</hi> I muſt leave thee, the curſe of Poverty drives me from thy Arms, and the jealous gods have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy'd my paſt happineſs. <hi>I</hi> muſt wander from my ſelf, for if <hi>I</hi> retain my ſtrength of judgment, <hi>I</hi> carry Hell about me—But ſure my kind Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory won't in this exigency forſake me, ſhe'll ſtand the firſt ſhock of Fortune's Malice, and prompt me on to madneſs, awake me from a Lethargy of ſorrow, and by preſenting thee to my view, give a new edge to my Afflictions; divide <hi>Valentio</hi> from the Husband, and oppreſs me with a double load, ſend me raving into the other World, curſing my Stars, my Fortune, nay—the gods, but moſt of all my ſelf—yet bleſſing thee.</p>
                     <p>In this afflicting juncture my Courage fail'd me. I ſaw miſery before me, and thought my ſelf already contemn'd and trampl'd upon, by
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:179798:119"/> every Fool, whoſe Fortune (not Merit) had beſtow'd upon him a larger ſtock of Wealth than mine; for Virtue when o'reclouded with Poverty gains no eſteem, and he that's poor may ſpeak like an Oracle, yet unregarded, while the rich (whoſe wit will hardly allow him the title of a Man) ſpeaks weighty Sentences, is aplauded by cringing fawning Knaves, and bubl'd into a Love of his own ignorance. Poor <hi>Valentio,</hi> read my thoughts in my Eyes, and (after a deep ſigh that expreſt ſorrow to the life) he fell into a new Delirium, exclaim'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt juſt Heaven, and wiſh'd for Thunder from the gods incens'd, to drive his tortur'd Soul unto the ſhades; that the Centre would open and ſwallow down his Body, or falling Mountains hide his guilty Head. Then reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on what he had ſaid, he begg'd Heaven's pardon for himſelf, and protection for his weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Delia;</hi> took me into his Arms, laid my Head to his beating Heart, and conjur'd me (in the name of all the gods) to forgive him, to Love him much, or elſe forget him ſoon.—Now, divine <hi>Sirena,</hi> let me drop the Curtain, and hide a Scene ſo moving, that my frighted Soul ſtarts at the view. <hi>We lov'd and parted,</hi> and let that expreſs the whole.</p>
                     <p>When he was gone, my cares for him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd, I had forgot a thouſand things I had to ſay to him, nor could I tell to what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try he deſign'd to commit himſelf. My Uncle (by Nature cruel) ſmil'd at my miſery, and I had no comfort but the Tears of my Servants; of that too I rob'd my ſelf, and diſcharg'd them all, excepting one Maid who had been with
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:179798:119"/> me from my infancy. His incens'd Creditors ſeiz'd upon his Eſtate, and I withdrew to a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houſe (ſome days Journey from that place) where I liv'd unknown, and ſecur'd from ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt wants by Jewels of conſiderable value, which my <hi>Valentio</hi> had left me.</p>
                     <p>In a few Months I brought a Son into the World, and tho' I ſaw not a Fortune ſufficient to maintain him like the Heir of the great <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> yet I was o're-joy'd at this Gift of Heaven, and methought I read already in his Face the features of his Godlike Father; yet this comfort was ſcarce able to allay my griefs; I ſigh'd for my abſent Husband, and conſum'd whole Nights in Prayers for his ſafety. Thus I liv'd without any change of Fortune, till one Morning as I ſat by a River's ſide, and recounted my paſt ills, I eſpy'd on Horſeback one of my old Servants. This ſharpned my memory, and brought <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> to my Soul, with all his graces and raviſhing looks about him. But as I began to create this ſoothing Phantom, the Man approach'd; and with a merry Countenance told me <hi>Arates</hi> was dead. That to me he had left his Fortune, and that Heaven thought it fitting to reward my Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Conſtancy. This News brought more grief than joy; for I no ſooner remembred my ſudden flight to Happineſs, than I conſidered my Husband's abſence. If he had been preſent how bleſs'd we had grown, Friends had encreas'd with our Fortune, and Love had Crown'd our joys.</p>
                     <p>In a few days I poſſeſt my Fathers Houſe, where his Brother had made me ſo long a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and was viſited by moſt of the Quality in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:179798:120"/> the Country, and among'ſt thoſe <hi>Valentio</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, all wiſh'd the Youth at home, but none yet knew that Kingdom in which he reſided. A midſt this pomp I found my Love for him held the firſt place in my Breaſt. Muſick encreas'd my melancholy, and Scenes of mirth fann'd the paſſion to a height. At laſt another change befel me, which in ſhort was this.</p>
                     <p>My Son was indiſpos'd, and I had laid him upon the Bed, where ſoon after falling aſleep, I was oblig'd to endeavour the ſame ſtate of ſilence to ſecure his; ſo that in a few Minutes (my Maids having quit the Room for fear of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſturbance) my ſenſes were partly huſh'd, and I lay by him in that Condition, which ſpeaks the Soul not perfectly awake, or capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a ſeries of coherent thoughts, yet not wholly o'recome with the weight of drowſie Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I had ſpent five tedious Years alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any real comfort, but the ſmiles of my Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Infant, and therefore dreamt my poor <hi>Valentio</hi> dead. Methought I ſaw him pale and trembling at my Bed's ſide, accuſing me of that I ne're committed; then threatning ſad revenge for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Honour, yet in his fury ſtill with-held by Love. This ſuddenly rouz'd my wandering Judgment, and ſtarting with the quick return of ſcatter'd thoughts, I leapt from the Bed, call'd for <hi>Valentio,</hi> ſought him through the Room, as if I had really ſeen him, then laughing at my own frenzy, I retir'd into my Cloſet, where (to my infinite ſurprize) a Cavaleer (nobly dreſt) caught me in his Arms, and cry'd, Oh <hi>Delia! Delia!—</hi>I have thee—I ſee thee—my Reaſon runs to madneſs with exceſs of Joy, and I
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:179798:120"/> could ſink beneath the vaſt load of ſoothing pleaſure. The Charming voice ſoon inform'd my watchful Soul.—Oh gods!—Oh too kind Heav'n! (I cry'd) my Husband!—my <hi>Valentio!—</hi>my Love! Oh what ſhall I ſay? gladneſs confounds me, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> am dumb with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie. To expreſs this meeting, Madam, I need ſay no more than that our Tears of Joy were as numerous as thoſe of ſorrow at our parting, when we never dreamt of being bleſt again. My haſty impatient fancy ſtarted a thouſand queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ſpoke my love out-run my tardy Judgment, and he (who had as much to ask as my ſelf) anſwer'd in one word, and made new demands in the next. We gaz'd on each other, then embrac'd, kiſs'd the dear pledge of our Loves (who was now awake) ſigh'd, and bill'd again like cooing Turtles in a ſhady Grove, where peeping lights inform them ſtorms are paſt, and they may perch again on loftier Boughs. When the firſt tranſports were over, I inform'd him of my. Fortunes, and he (to oblige me) gave this ſuccinct and Curſory account of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <p>WHen I left thee (my lovely <hi>Delia)</hi> I felt all thoſe pains which could poſſeſs a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Soul; one who had lov'd, and made the Centre of his wiſhes miſerable, while her good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (that permitted her not to complain) ſhow'd (in more lively colours) the horror of his guilt. I had not before that time examin'd my own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and being wholly indifferent in what Country I ſpent the remainder of hated life, I rid ſome days rather a confus'd Wanderer, than
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:179798:121"/> a formal or reſolv'd Traveller. At laſt I arriv'd (after 7 Months ſpent on the way) at a Frontier Town of <hi>Peru-alta,</hi> and there having learnt the Language of the Country, I went to the Camp, where the preſent King <hi>Pharnaces</hi> reſided in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I had not ſtay'd long, e're <hi>oppertunity</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd her ſelf to my advantage, <hi>Fortune</hi> courted my wiſhes, and preſented the Enemy to our view. We encounter'd, and (my loſſes having taught me how to value my Perſon) I did more than ſolid Reaſon could aſſent to, and had the honour to ſave my General when diſmounted, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt trod to death by the Enemies Horſe, who ruſh'd on in joyful crowds at their ſeeming Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not coveting blood ſo much as a noble Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. This piece of ſervice gain'd me his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and eſteem, and his Kinſman (the haughty young <hi>Antharſus)</hi> ſhow'd me not a few ſigns of his good will. But Winter ſoon follow'd the Battel, and the Scene (where honour was to be got) withdrew, and left the impatient Youth of the Army in their Winter Quarters, wiſhing a return of the Year, that <hi>Mars</hi> would again ſhow his Head, and rouze their dying Spirits. When that time came, my grateful General, who remember'd my paſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, gave me the Command of five hundred Horſe. And having receiv'd Orders to view the poſture of the Enemy, I found my ſelf encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a Wood by a greater Number. My men ſhrunk when firſt aſſaulted, and offer'd to ſecure themſelves by flight. But ſeeing that reſiſtance I made with the remaining few, and finding the way ſtopt, they became more reſolute, and turn'd to ſell their lives for dear-bought honour. In this Engagement I loſt three hundred and fifty Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:179798:121"/> kill'd of the Enemy ſeven hundred and nine, and return'd to the Camp with ſourſcore Priſoners, of which he that commanded the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Party was one. The General (who was more o're joy'd at my ſucceſs than my ſelf) ſwore ſuch an Action as this deſerv'd to be eternally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd, and next day preſented me to the King, at which time <hi>I</hi> had the Honour to kiſs his Hand, and to be ſtil'd the Soul of his Army. <hi>Reduan</hi> (for that was the General's name) extoll'd my Valour to the Skies, and the Queen (who was preſent) readily anſwer'd ſhe believ'd all, for the Countenance of the Noble Stranger ſpoke his Praiſes to the World, e're he opened his mouth. <hi>I</hi> thankt her with that reſpect her Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity inſpir'd, and her Daughter (the Princeſs <hi>Almeria)</hi> whoſe Eyes were fix'd on mine, bluſh'd as I ſpoke.</p>
                     <p>Fortune (not yet wearied of doing good) brought me once more into the Field, where I ſav'd the King's Life twice in one hour, and was at Night preferr'd to the Poſt of Captain of his Majeſty's Guards, Gentleman of the Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Knight of the <hi>Dacian</hi> Order. <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi>'s Fortune never equall'd mine, for in leſs than ſix weeks after my Advancement, <hi>I</hi> beat the Enemy thrice; and at laſt drove them to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſuing for a Peace. The old King ſtill entruſting me with his Army, while the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Reduan</hi> (wearied with the Toyls of War) attended his Prince's perſon, and ſaw the youth of <hi>Peru-alta</hi> ſweating in blood for the ſmiles of that airy Miſtreſs, Honour, of who's favour and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip he himſelf had been long poſſeſt.</p>

                     <p> Things being at laſt compos'd to <hi>Pharnaces</hi> advantage, he abandon'd the hardſhips of a Camp for the ſofter pleaſures of a Palace, and fix'd his moving Court on the Banks of the River <hi>Sapho.</hi> I had a ſtately Appartment aſſign'd me within the Gates, and at Night felt my ſelf a Priſoner in a guilded Cage; thou my Dear <hi>Delia</hi> fill'd my Soul, I thought I ſaw thee penſive and alone, deſpis'd by all, and ſhun'd by thoſe who knew thee, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Friends and without me, reflecting on thy paſt happineſs, and mourning the preſent ſtate; I've ſigh'd for thee till my heaving Heart has ſhook the tottering Bed, and waking implor'd the Pity of the Gods, or if I dreamt, my Soul was with her I lov'd, ſurvey'd her Charms, and return'd to glad my longing Heart, which too ſoon found out the tempting Cheat, and weep'd becauſe it no longer cozen'd.</p>
                     <p>One Night while I lay in this Melancholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, a ſmall noiſe on the Stairs ſurpriz'd me, immediately after my door was opened, and I could ſee the Queen enter my Chamber with a light in her hand. I feign'd a dead ſleep, and ſhe who took it for real, approach'd my Bed without any ſigns of fear. Stood almoſt motion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, gaz'd upon me, ſigh'd, and then retir'd. This odd ſort of viſit very much affected me, and tho' <hi>I</hi> had ſome grounds to ſuſpect the Cauſe, yet it gave me matter enough for a great many reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But while I div'd into this Myſtery, my Door was a ſecond time ſet open, and I could hear a Woman's Foot preſs the floor, who after a ſhort ſtay withdrew, and ſuddenly re-enter'd with a Candle, coming to my Bed's ſide, ſhe
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:179798:122"/> ſhow'd the Beauties of an Angel. She had a looſe embroider'd Night-Gown about her, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times flew open, and diſcover'd to the View a thouſand raviſhing Charms, her tender Shapes glanc'd through the fine wrought Shift, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt gave Enjoyment by the ſight, and I had no doubt ſhown my ſelf awake, if ſhe had not in a few Minutes abandon'd the Room. When ſhe was gone, how ſoon did <hi>Delia</hi>'s lovelier form check my wandering fancy, and I damn'd my paſt wiſhes when I thought of thee. Thy Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſtill ſurmounts hers, and that of all Women, and <hi>Almeria</hi> (for 'twas ſhe) ſoon vaniſh'd from my Soul.</p>
                     <p>Next morning the King, Queen, and Princes went a Hunting, attended by moſt of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. As we paſt a ſpacious Heath ſome Miles from Court, it was my Fortune to ride next to her Majeſty; ſhe ey'd me with a pleaſant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and told me ſhe preſum'd by my looks, <hi>I</hi> came abroad to catch Hearts, that my Eyes had tenderneſs in them, and <hi>I</hi> could not fail of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Fair Priſoner. This obliging diſcourſe put me to the Bluſh, and <hi>I</hi> was at a loſs for ſome time what to anſwer. While ſhe, who was no ſtranger to intrigue and Gallantry, reaſſum'd the diſcourſe, and told me that <hi>I</hi> was not oblig'd to ſtudy for an anſwer, ſince one kind look, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching ſmile, was enough to repay a thouſand ſuch complements. Adding, ſhe ſuppos'd <hi>I</hi> was Born a ſtranger to <hi>Peru-alta,</hi> I ow'd my Birth to ſome colder Climate, where Love was not the grand buſineſs of the Nation, that with them ſuch addreſſes were common, that ſhe was not yet very
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:179798:123"/> old, and the King already doated. Believe me <hi>Delia I</hi> knew not how to anſwer; the Letchery of the Royal Baud exceeded what I e're had ſeen in all my travels: But juſt as <hi>I</hi> was ready to ſpeak, (and the ſparkling of her Eyes inform'd me ſhe wanted a return) the King approach'd, and <hi>I</hi> bleſt my Stars for the lucky hit. With the firſt opportunity I choſe another Road, and fell into a new ſnare, ſtudying to evite the old. For <hi>Almeria</hi> (who had ſeen me with her Mother) ſmiling ask'd me, if the Charms of a Queen had gain'd my Heart, if Majeſty and Power could do more than Youth, and a moderate portion of Beauty. This ſtrange Method very much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd me, <hi>I</hi> had conſider'd but faintly the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of theſe Ladies, and almoſt fancy'd the King's Jealouſie the cauſe of all, that they flatter'd to try me, and ſeem'd fond to advance my ruine. However as I was about to reply, <hi>Antharſus</hi> came galloping up, and <hi>I</hi> was opportunely reliev'd from a ſecond <hi>Dilemma.</hi> He ſhow'd a vaſt ſubmiſſion to the Princeſs's Commands, and the leaſt of his Actions ſpoke his care to pleaſe, yet he did all with an Air that ſpoke him inwardly proud, and of a ſurly diſpoſition. <hi>Almeria</hi> fretted at the accident, and by her Converſation gave him undoubted marks of her diſpleaſure. The haughty young Souldier eaſily obſerv'd it, and gueſt the cauſe. The Natives of that Country are generally blacker than thoſe of <hi>Merintha,</hi> and a Man of my Complexion ſeem'd a Demi-God amongſt them. Next day <hi>I</hi> had a Note ſent me to this purpoſe.</p>

                     <p>This did not much ſurpriſe me, I knew the Cauſe, he envy'd my Fortune, and judg'd I had robb'd him of his Honour, and that eſteem the King and Army had of him, but moſt of all he grudg'd me <hi>Reduan</hi>'s favour and <hi>Almeria</hi>'s. In the mean time I fail'd not to wait upon him, and without a recital of Particulars, know, I got Victory on my ſide, for after he had receiv'd three Wounds, he fell with his Sword in his Hand. <hi>I</hi> ſoon order'd the Body to be taken up, and in my Coach (which waited at a ſmall diſtance) ſent him to his Apartment in the Court. Then going ſtraight to the King, <hi>I</hi> fell upon my Knees, begg'd his Pardon, and confeſt the truth of what had paſt. The old Man weigh'd not the Challenge ſent me, and giving way to his paſſion, commanded me inſtantly to Priſon. <hi>I</hi> laid my Sword at my Prince's Feet, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out murmuring obey'd. At Night (when all was huſht) <hi>Almeria</hi> came to ſee me, ſhe urg'd her Love, the hazard ſhe run for this dear Viſit, bid me hope for ſudden Freedom, and ſwore ſhe'd abandon the proſpect of being a Queen, rather than <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſuffer. While ſhe ſpoke
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:179798:124"/> the generous <hi>Reduan</hi> enter'd, and ſeeing the Princeſs, was about to retire; but ſhe kindly call'd him back, told him ſhe was fully aſſur'd of his Honeſty and Friendſhip, and would conceal nothing from him; my Friend begg'd her Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and mine for the indiſcretion of his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and (knowing the Prince's mind) added he was glad of that choice ſhe had made, for no Man could better fill the Throne of <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> than the Warlike <hi>Valentio,</hi> (for <hi>I</hi> had not chang'd my Name, becauſe aſſur'd none knew from whence <hi>I</hi> came) that my Conduct ſpoke my Quality anſwerable to my Fortune, and my Courage fit for Empire. The Royal Maid was pleas'd with what he ſaid, and in the mean time ask'd him what expedient he could propoſe for my Liberty? he (who ever eſteem'd me beyond my Merit) advis'd her to confeſs to her Father that affection ſhe had for me, which in the firſt place would ſecure my Life, if his Kinſman (who was dangerouſly wounded) dy'd; and <hi>Pharnaces</hi> having no more Children, could not (with reaſon ſafe) croſs her inclinations too far, leſt he ſhould endanger her Health. Kind <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria</hi> at firſt was ſilent, but conſulting Love, ſhe gave conſent; deſiring <hi>Reduan</hi> firſt to ſpeak favourably of me, and give him a hint of her paſſion, that ſhe might not have the firſt ſhock of his fury, which would undoubtedly follow the unlook'd for News.</p>
                     <p>The General fail'd not to obey, and <hi>Pharna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> (naturally haſty) ſtorm'd at what he heard, wonder'd he ſhould favour the murderer of his Kinſman, and a ſtranger, and ſwore my Life
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:179798:124"/> ſhould anſwer for the Crime committed. My good old Friend alledg'd, he ought not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <hi>Valentio</hi> as a Foreigner, but the preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Life and Honour, and one who poſſeſt the affection of his Souldiers and Daughter; as he pronounc'd theſe laſt Words the Princeſs enter'd, and by her Tears mollified the ſtubborn old Man; (for thoſe ſubject to ſudden anger are eaſily perſwaded) you may believe, my <hi>Delia, I</hi> long'd to be inform'd of the ſucceſs, and was pleaſantly ſurpris'd when my Lieutenant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, ſhow'd my Keeper his Orders, reſtor'd me my Sword, and told me <hi>I</hi> was again a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite. <hi>I</hi> knew this ſudden Change an effect of <hi>Almeria</hi>'s Love, <hi>Reduan</hi>'s Friendſhip, and the Queen's Dotage, for as <hi>I</hi> was inform'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by her ſelf, ſhe forgot not to intercede for me with her eaſie Husband; <hi>Pharnaces</hi> receiv'd me with a calm brow, the Daughter bluſh'd, and the Mother bid me by her looks conſider her as the Author of my Liberty. <hi>I</hi> was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongſt them, thou (my Dear) poſſeſt my Heart, <hi>Almeria</hi> my eſteem, <hi>Reduan</hi> my Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Gratitude, and the Queen my pity with a mixture of averſion. In the evening <hi>I</hi> went along with the General, and ſaw <hi>Anthar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> ſhow'd my grief for my own good Fortune, begg'd he'd believe me his well-wiſher, and ſwore <hi>I</hi> was ready to ſerve him at all times, and upon all occaſions.</p>
                     <p>A few days after the King took me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and having call'd for <hi>Reduan,</hi> we enter'd his Cloſet, tho not before Orders given to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the thronging Courtiers, that he was not
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:179798:125"/> to be ſeen. <hi>Valentio</hi> (ſaid he with a kind air) my Daughter loves you too much, and though <hi>I</hi> have that eſteem for you which all good Men have, yet <hi>I</hi> ſhould be ſorry, if <hi>I</hi> were oblig'd to give my Crown to a Man who has none of my Progenitors blood in his Veins, beſides my Subjects will never ſubmit patiently to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a ſtranger. Adviſe with your Friend and mine, and (if poſſible) find a method by which <hi>I</hi> may be ſecur'd from my juſt fears, and <hi>Almeria</hi>'s too violent paſſion may be kept a ſecret. <hi>I</hi> readily propos'd my abſence, to which he and <hi>Reduan</hi> ſeem'd much averſe, and forc'd me to ſecond thoughts. <hi>I</hi> had conceal'd my Marriage from them both, and was now irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute if I ſhould inform them; but finding no other way to eſcape, <hi>I</hi> confeſs'd the truth, told them, <hi>I</hi> had a Wife with the Face of an Angel, and the perfections of a goddeſs, one whom <hi>I</hi> could never ceaſe to Love, and for whoſe ſake <hi>I</hi> would abandon more than Empire. <hi>Pharna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> rejoyc'd at the Diſcovery, and generous <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duan</hi> was rather pleas'd than incens'd, becauſe (as he ſaid) <hi>I</hi> had Courage without extravagant Ambition, and a real Love without the baſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of Intereſt. The King (who was not long a plotting what next to do) conjur'd me to bring thee to Court, that nothing would ſooner quench <hi>Almeria</hi>'s flame, than to ſee me fond of another, whom <hi>I</hi> was more powerfully oblig'd to Love; that <hi>I</hi> ſhould ever be Maſter of my preſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and as opportunity offer'd, he'd advance me to a greater, that he was loath to loſe ſo good a Friend and Souldier, and if <hi>I</hi> left the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:179798:125"/> Court without deſigning a ſpeedy return, his Daughter would think it an effect of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and would for ever impute the loſs to him, languiſh for my abſence, and murmur at his cruelty; that if my <hi>Delia's</hi> preſence did not convince her of her errour, he'd afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon me a competency for Life, and <hi>I</hi> ſhould retire to what corner of the World <hi>I</hi> pleas'd. <hi>I</hi> left thee without a Fortune, <hi>I</hi> was ignorant of what Heaven had done for thee, and in a word, <hi>I</hi> embrac'd the offer. <hi>I</hi> kiſt the Queen's Hand, and that of the amorous young Princeſs, promis'd to return in a few Months, ſaw <hi>Antharſus</hi> in the way to perfect Health, and left the conſtant, kind <hi>Reduan</hi> ſorrowful for my abſence. On the road <hi>I</hi> had a thouſand Fears for thy ſafety, and when <hi>I</hi> dreamt thee Well, <hi>I</hi> joy'd becauſe my relenting Stars had made me Maſter of a Fortune ſuitable to thy Quality, tho' not Merit.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>I</hi> croſt the River of <hi>Tara,</hi> which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides <hi>Merintha</hi> from <hi>Amula, I</hi> was inform'd of <hi>Arates</hi>'s death, and coming ſtraight to this Houſe, <hi>I</hi> was told by your faithful Maid <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſa,</hi> that you was in this Chamber alone, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing the Story of my little Son, that you might glad my Soul with the welcome News. When <hi>I</hi> enter'd, <hi>I</hi> found you upon the Bed, and eſpying the Hat and Feather beyond you, (the obſcure light, for the Curtains were drawn, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying a full view of his Face) <hi>I</hi> had a thouſand ſudden Fears, <hi>I</hi> thought thee falſe, and in a height of unaccountable paſſion drew my Sword, with a deſign to puniſh the Treachery.—But
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:179798:126"/> oh, ye merciful gods! how raviſh'd <hi>I</hi> was to know my ſelf deceiv'd; for while<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>I</hi> ſtruggl'd between ſudden Paſſion, Love, and the weak remains of dying Reaſon, the lovely Boy mov'd. Pardon, O my <hi>Delia,</hi> (continued he, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me in his Arms) this Crime, which nothing but exceſs of Love can excuſe, and believe, that, ſatisfied and perſwaded of thy fidelity, <hi>I</hi> retir'd into the Cloſet, with that joy at my Heart, which none can know till doubly bleſs'd like me.</p>
                     <p>Here he ended his Relation, and <hi>I</hi> felt the motions of my Heart, which are not eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd. <hi>I</hi> griev'd the eaſineſs of his Nature, that by a ſeeming guilt ſuffer'd his Reaſon to be diſpoſſeſt, that unheard, he could reſolve to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and without Tryal pronounce my Doom. Yet theſe thoughts were ſoon remov'd, when <hi>I</hi> remembred his conſtancy, how for me he had renounc'd the hopes of a Crown, and for the ſmiles of a Wife, abandon'd courting Majeſty. But that which moſt rack'd me, was the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity <hi>I</hi> lay under, of traveiling to <hi>Peru-alta; I</hi> form'd to my ſelf a frightful <hi>Idea</hi> of the Court, dreaded the Queen and Princeſs, and thought <hi>Valentio</hi> already forc'd from my Arms between them. But then remembring how far his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was engaged, how gratitude forc'd his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and that he'd forfeit life ſooner than his Promiſe; how the King eſteem'd him, how <hi>Reduan</hi> lov'd him, and the intereſt his eminent Services had gain'd him in the Nation; <hi>I</hi> began by quick degrees to change thoſe thoughts, for
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:179798:126"/> others more agreeable. In a word, Madam, after a few Weeks we began our Journey, and becauſe nothing of conſequence hapned on the Road, (excepting that <hi>Meliſſa</hi> lay three days ſick) <hi>I</hi> ſhall change the Scene, and in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, place my ſelf at the Court of <hi>Pharnaces.</hi> The King ſwore himſelf o'rejoy'd at my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Arrival, <hi>Reduan</hi> ſhow'd a conſtant Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the Queen ſmil'd, and <hi>Almeria</hi> alone ſeem'd dejected. She upbraided <hi>Valentio</hi> with Treachery, becauſe he had diſſembl'd his real Circumſtances; yet ſaid ſhe forgave him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Charms of his happier <hi>Delia</hi> ſufficiently excus'd the Crime. The Youth at Court came frequently to ſee me, and <hi>Antharſus</hi> (who by the King's ſpecial Command was reconcil'd to my Husband) made always one in the Crow'd. He ſeem'd very much to affect my Maid, and believe me, Madam, ſhe out-did all the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at Court. The Princeſs, ('tis true) was lovely, and had a ſingular Majeſty in all her Actions, yet not ſo powerful in the aſſault of a Heart as <hi>Meliſſa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Things ſtood not long in this Poſture, for my Husband's ancient Enemy ſtill retain'd a perfect remembrance of the affront put upon him, and ſtudying revenge, at laſt this opportunity offer'd. The General and <hi>Valentio</hi> were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing concerning the Natures of Women, the conſtancy of ſome, and the weakneſs of others, if the Cauſes proceeded from the diſpoſition of the Body, or the Mind; and if any Man could aſſure himſelf of his Wife's fidelity, <hi>Reduan</hi> (according to his uſual goodneſs) ſwore my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:179798:127"/> was happy, that he believ'd his <hi>Delia</hi>'s Virtue proof againſt the ſtrongeſt Temptation, and <hi>I</hi> ſeem'd Miſtreſs of a Judgment of force to beat off thoſe aſſaults, which (with incredible eaſe) would o'return the reſolutions of others. <hi>Valentio</hi> thankt him for this Complement; and <hi>Antharſus</hi> ſwore all Women were fickle as the Winds; he'd debauch her, that pretended moſt to Chaſtity, and baniſh Virtue from her thoughts in leſs than three Days; that modeſty with our Sex, was but a Cloak to private Sins, our Nature's wavering (or rather veering) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the point of Vice, and with-held only by a fond Love of Reputation, which exactly weigh'd, is rather innate Pride. The General ſhow'd his diſlike of what he ſaid, and calmly bid him conſult his Reaſon e're he ſpoke; but my Husband who took impatiently every thing that came from him, and who knew the words levell'd againſt himſelf in particular, told him (with anger in his looks) that <hi>Delia</hi> was proof againſt him and all Men, that he ſhould have acceſs to his Houſe, and if <hi>I</hi> chang'd my Love, or endanger'd his Honour, he'd forfeit his Life. <hi>Antharſus</hi> ſuddenly reply'd, 'twas too great a Wager, but he'd lay his Fortune at ſtake, (a common Bet in that Country) that <hi>Valentio</hi> ſhould abſent himſelf for three Days, and at his return receive undeniable proofs of his errour in truſting to a Woman. Honeſt <hi>Reduan</hi> chid his Kinſman, and oppos'd the budding miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. But my Husband (confident of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct) was reſolute, and ſwore he would not upon any terms deſiſt; and that a few Days
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:179798:127"/> would experimentally teach the young Man, not to truſt too much to his Merit, or to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his Perſon or Parts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Valentio</hi> ſoon writ to me, by which <hi>I</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, he had receiv'd ſudden Orders from the King, that he was oblig'd to viſit a Town ſome Miles diſtant, and <hi>I</hi> ſhould not expect his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn till the fourth Day following <hi>Anthar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> (already half aſſur'd of ſucceſs) came imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to ſee me, and took care that moſt of his acquaintance ſhould have notice of his Viſit, he frequented the Windows, and upon every trivial Occaſion fool'd me thither, that all might know us together: At Night he enter'd privately, and finding <hi>Meliſſa</hi> in her Chamber, he renew'd his Addreſſes to her, ſhe (whom Ambition had blinded) had ſcarce the power to deny him any thing. He ſwore boundleſs Love for her, and ſeem'd to deſire nothing more than a ſpeedy Marriage between them. With this bait he eaſily deluded the credulous Maid, and gave her large preſents to confirm her in the miſtake. On the other hand, he propos'd no other proof of her affection, than the delivery of that thing which her Miſtreſs moſt eſteem'd, and which ſhe knew <hi>Valentio</hi> had given me. She readily comply'd, and (while I ſlept) ſtole the Key of my Cabinet, taking from thence this Croſs which now you ſee, and which my Husband had given me when he fled from <hi>Merintha.</hi> The young Man (glad of his feign'd Victory) gave her a Jewel of a conſiderable value, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd her to conceal this Tranſaction from all the World, and retired to his own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:179798:128"/> eas'd becauſe he had begun his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val's ruin.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Valentio</hi> return'd, he ſaw too ſoon the ſtoln mark of fictitious Conqueſt, and believ'd me baſe. He diſſembl'd all when in my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, tho' not ſo well as to blind my fore-boding Soul. I askt the cauſe of his diſcontent, and he reaſſum'd his old excuſe, want of Health. Thus we liv'd, I was ignorant of what had paſt, he jealous and tormented, <hi>Meliſſa</hi> glad of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fortune, and <hi>Antharſus</hi> fond of his own Villany. The Nights were ſpent with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent paſſions on all ſides, and Day was always welcome to my watchful Soul.</p>
                     <p>One Morning the loſt <hi>Valentio</hi> askt me if <hi>I</hi> would go with him into the Fields: I readily conſented, and having ſeated our ſelves in the Coach, we drove a Mile by the River's ſide, and then alighted. Sorrow preſt his Brow, and his looks ſpoke his Heart plung'd in grief; yet ſtill methought <hi>I</hi> read anger (or rather gloomy revenge) in his Eyes. We walkt another whole Mile without exchange of Words, and my Heart (ſinking with the ſudden apprehenſion of ſome coming miſchief) taught me to expect greater troubles than yet <hi>I</hi> had known. While thus we walkt he caught me in his Arms, cry'd aloud, This for my Honour loſt! Now Love <hi>Antharſus!</hi> Then threw me head-long down the hanging Bank. The Streams with mercy yet receiv'd me, and my Cloaths kept me a-float, till a Neighbouring Shepherd came to my relief. The poor Man took me home to his Houſe, and made uſe of Remedies within his Power to bring
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:179798:128"/> me back to Life. When my Reaſon reaſſum'd its Seat, <hi>I</hi> enquir'd of my deliverer, if any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man appear'd to ſave me from ſinking, and he aſſur'd me he had ſeen none. 'Tis not eaſie, Madam, to gueſs my Pains. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred every word my Husband ſpoke, when he plung'd me into the River; how furiouſly he look'd, and how his Eye-balls roll'd, that I was innocent, his Cruelty even beyond his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he had long deſign'd my Death, and that Repentance had not immediately follow'd the act, ſince he had not ſtaid to afford me help when I ſtruggl'd in the Water. Yet after all I lov'd him, 'twas that tormented my Soul, and I could have dy'd that very moment, if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of evincing my Innocence had not o're-rul'd that of Life.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time I was not to be found at Court; <hi>Antharſus</hi> induſtriouſly gave out, that <hi>Valentio</hi> had murder'd his Wife; and the King, who thought it an effect of ambition, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to make way for his Marriage with <hi>Alme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> eaſily believ'd what was ſaid, and gave im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate orders for his cloſe Confinement. Now careleſs of Life and Honour, (ſince by his own Hands he had deſtroy'd what his Soul yet doated on) frankly confeſs'd the Crime laid to his charge, and tho' the Queen, the Princeſs, and ſorrowful <hi>Reduan</hi> us'd their intereſt with <hi>Pharnaces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> he was nevertheleſs brought to his Tryal, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to loſe his Head at his own Gate. The falſe <hi>Meliſſa</hi> did not yet grieve for what ſhe had done, and urg'd <hi>Antharſus</hi> to the performance of his promiſe. The proud Youth was ſtartled
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:179798:129"/> with the propoſal, and conſidering the vaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between a Princeſs and a ſerving Maid, he ſhow'd her not a few ſigns of contempt. She ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd this, and to hector him into Compliance and good Nature, alledg'd the ſervice ſhe had done him, his Vows, and the opportunity ſhe had to render him infamous by a full diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He, who fear'd nothing more, and who ſcrupl'd not to add one Crime to another, run her againſt the Table with his Sword, and ſo left her, pleas'd by a greater miſchief to conceal a leſſer. <hi>Meliſſa</hi> (now mortally wounded) faintly call'd for aſſiſtance; and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duan</hi> with ſeveral Officers entering, ſhe confeſt her guilt, told them <hi>Antharſus</hi> had us'd her thus for fear of a diſcovery, begg'd my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Pardon, (tho abſent) and ſoon after dy'd. I had ſent the poor Shepherd every day to Court, where (his Wife being a Nurſe) he got certain information of all that paſt; and I was acquainted with this Accident, almoſt as ſoon as it happened. Then it was I went to ſee <hi>Valentio—</hi>Pardon, Madam, this too conciſe way of relating my Story; but the remembrance of that Joy he ſhow'd, when he knew me alive, adds to my preſent pain, and makes me more ſenſible of my loſs. Beſides, I find the kind Siſter extends her welcome Arm to cut my thread of Life. I have no more time than ſerves to inform you; <hi>Antharſus</hi> fled, My Husband was ſet at Liberty. We left <hi>Peru-alta</hi> as ſoon as poſſible, and deſigning to viſit <hi>Fabria</hi> in our return to <hi>Merintha,</hi> that ſtorm aroſe when we were upon the Coaſt, which
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:179798:129"/> robb'd me of my Son and Husband.—Oh <hi>Valentio!—</hi>I come!—now I'm—happy.—</p>
                     <p>This ſaid, ſhe immediately dy'd, and one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment finiſh'd her ſtory, and her unfortunate Life. The Duke and Dutcheſs were ſorry for her Death, and in a few days ſhe was laid in the ſame Grave with her <hi>Valentio. Manderina</hi> had waited upon her too when alive, and during that ſmall ſpace of time, we renew'd our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Friendſhip; ſhe ask'd me concerning my Brother, and wiſh'd him ſucceſs at <hi>Coloa;</hi> I wiſh'd her happineſs, but not in the Arms of <hi>Martius,</hi> and ſhe (not inclin'd that way ſo much as <hi>I</hi> had ſuſpected) ſmil'd, and ſaid, he deſerv'd my Love but not hers; to me he ſhow'd himſelf a Priſoner, but to her a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and one whom no Beauty could fix, or Charms confine. <hi>Artaxus</hi> inform'd me by his Letters, that <hi>Indoretta</hi> ſtill prov'd kind, that <hi>Fernanthus</hi> Duke of <hi>Meroa</hi> (a mad piece of Quality) was his dang'rous Rival, becauſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with <hi>Mangroa</hi>'s Authority, that he was oblig'd to live too incognito, and did not yet know when he would return.—Now, my dear <hi>Timandra,</hi> my Story draws towards a fatal Period, my Misfortunes exceed yours, and my Ruine was compleated by envious Deſtiny, in leſs than twenty days after the death of unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Delia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My Welcome Lover had come to ſee me at the uſual hour, and after ſome time ſpent in my
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:179798:130"/> Company deſcended again into the Garden. <hi>Bonzeda</hi> it ſeems waited there with a deſign to ſerenade me, and approach'd the Window juſt as <hi>Martius</hi> was upon the foot of his ſupple Stairs. The Youth finding himſelf ſurpris'd, and not knowing their intention, or whom they were, drew his Sword, and laid the unwary Count dead at his feet. <hi>Xenſa</hi> (who was not yet aſleep, and too ſoon heard the noiſe) came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning down the back Stairs; but not examining the Party or the Cauſe, he choſe the weakeſt ſide, and was kill'd by <hi>Bonzeda</hi>'s Servants, e're he had well enter'd the Garden. Poor <hi>Martius</hi> ſtill defended himſelf, and the back door be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuddenly broke open, a Cavalier ruſh'd in to his aſſiſtance. The claſhing of the Swords, with the confus'd Shrieks and Oaths of thoſe engag'd, awak'd both Families, and now a bloody Combat commenc'd (or rather was renw'd) the Count's Servants fought to revenge their Maſter's full, and my Lover for his Liberty. At laſt he was a Conquerour, and the Enemy fled. 'Twas then he had leiſure to thank the Stranger for his aſſiſtance. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this bloody Scene, <hi>I</hi> had ſtill ſlept, and it ſeems my kind Lover, (more cautious for my Reputation th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n my ſelf) had left me in that condition, chuſing rather to leave me without a word at parting than run the riſque of a diſcovery by his ſtay. However, I awak'd juſt as they enter'd my Chamber, and ſeeing <hi>Martius</hi> and my Brother (for 'twas he that had aſſiſted him) cover'd with blood, I leapt from the Bed, ask'd the Cauſe, and almoſt rav'd
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:179798:130"/> with the ſudden fright. My Lover (ſtill an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious for me) would have conceal'd the truth, till he had prepar'd my mind for the ſhock; but <hi>Artaxus</hi> in few words inform'd me of all, and added that <hi>Ericis</hi> had ſeen him in <hi>Coloa;</hi> that ſhe acquainted <hi>Meroa</hi> with it, who ſoon after ſent him a Challenge, that he fought him, and had the fortune to kill him, that he had poſted home with a deſign to provide himſelf with Mony, and to ſettle his affairs; that as he arriv'd, he heard the claſhing of Swords in the Garden, and forc'd the Door from off its hinges, to give relief to thoſe oppreſs'd. Madam, you may paint my griefs from your own: And tho' the loſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> exceeded that of a Father, yet to remove the inequality, I ſaw my Brother and my Lover oblig'd to abandon <hi>Fabria.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to make my miſery truly equal to your own, I was robb'd of <hi>Martius</hi> and <hi>Artaxus</hi> too. For they had not been gone ſix Months, (during which time, I receiv'd many Letters from them) when <hi>I</hi> was inform'd of both their deaths; the occaſion of which take in few words.</p>
                     <p>They had fled into the Province of <hi>Cathinna,</hi> where wearied with ſo long an abſence from thoſe they lov'd, they at laſt reſolv'd upon a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney home. By the way they lodg'd in a ſmall Village, where (not finding conveniences for lying together as they us'd to do) they choſe their reſpective <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nns. At Night my Lover's Hoſt, diſcours'd the ſtory of <hi>Xenſa</hi>'s and <hi>Bonze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>'s death, and how young <hi>Mangroa</hi> had by his flight confeſs'd himſelf guilty of the Murder.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:179798:131"/> 
                        <hi>Martius</hi> was very much ſurpris'd with the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſcarce thought himſelf ſafe; but being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of an invincible courage, theſe thoughts ſoon fled, and he retir'd to his Chamber. My Brother's fortune was almoſt the ſame; for his Hoſteſs ſpent moſt of the Night on his Adventure concerning <hi>Fernanthus;</hi> and being at Supper with him, ſhe ſaid to her Husband, This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman (looking on my Brother) very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles Young <hi>Xenſa;</hi> if he is the ſame Fame paints him amongſt us. <hi>Artaxus</hi> ſmil'd, and ſoon after went to bed, where (wearied with his Journey) he fell aſleep, and dreamt no more of what had paſt. About midnight the Houſe was ſurrounded with Arm'd men, their leader crying, guard the Doors, and ſecure the Murderer. It ſeems, Madam, a High-Way Man, who had robb'd, and afterwards kill'd a Gentleman, ten Miles from that place, had come to the ſame Inn that Evening, but not known to be ſuch, he had pay'd his reckoning and purſu'd another Road. The now Duke of <hi>Xenſa</hi> ſurpris'd with the ſudden noiſe, ſtarted from the Bed, and laid hold of his Sword, reſolv'd either to purchaſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, or fall in the attempt. In the mean time <hi>Martius</hi> could find no reſt, he dreamt of ſome coming danger, yet knew not what it was, and fear'd my Brother's ſafety more than his own. At laſt hearing a noiſe in the Streets, he call'd his watchful Hoſt; and enquir'd into the cauſe. He ſoon inform'd him, and the Youth (judging my Brother betray'd) half dreſt, and Arm'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his Sword, run to his aſſiſtance, and came iuſt as <hi>Artaxus</hi> had engag'd with the furious
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:179798:131"/> Mobb, who, by his reſiſtance, and deſperate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to eſcape, eaſily believ'd him the Robber, and us'd their utmoſt force to repel his. Young <hi>Mangroa</hi> no ſooner arriv'd, than he made his way through the Rabble, and calling aloud for <hi>Artaxus,</hi> at laſt reach'd him. <hi>Xenſa</hi> hearing his own name proclaim'd, concludes they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knew him, and not diſcerning his Friend in the dark, or remembring his Voice in the hurry, he turn'd his Sword upon him, as his moſt dangerous Enemy; becauſe next to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. My Lover from his reſiſtance argu'd his own miſtake, and ſought to ſecure himſelf by the death of his Adverſary.—Oh! Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Heavens! they both fell, my Brother was kill'd by my Lover, and <hi>Artaxus</hi> robb'd me of <hi>Martius.—</hi>Judge of my ſorrow by my misfortune, for I'm perſwaded, Madam, no loſs ever equall'd mine. The Dutcheſs dy'd with ſudden grief. The conſtant <hi>Indoretta</hi> poyſon'd her ſelf, and the kind <hi>Manderina</hi> languiſh'd a few Months, and then fled into the other World. <hi>I</hi> had then retir'd from pomp and noiſe, and ſpent the remainder of my Years in Devotions, if my Friends had not over-perſwaded me to the Contrary, and with cunning Arguments had not juggl'd me into a love of Liberty, and averſion to a recluſe Monaſtick Life. However, in not abandoning the World, I had the Happineſs of your acquaintance, for you came to my Houſe, Madam, two Years after this Tragedy had been Acted.—Excuſe me if I have not Writ my Letter with that Art you ſhow in yours, or if <hi>I</hi> have dwelt too long upon the ſtory of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
